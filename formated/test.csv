I‚Äôve dealt with depression for my entire life, I‚Äôve even tried to kill myself multiple times, but yesterday was the first time I‚Äôve ever self-harmed. I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it; I suppose I did it to know that I can still feel at all. 

Short background and what made me want to hurt myself: I recently got a great job, moved out of my toxic hometown, have been staying with a friend until I could get my own place, met a girl and we started dating. Finally found an apartment that I love, got denied. My girlfriend left me the same day. These type of situations wouldn‚Äôt normally get to me, but things were finally starting to go my way for the first time in my life, and all in one day, I was back to feeling as awful as I always have been. I was drinking last night and decided to hurt myself, and I liked it, but when I went out to get food today, they lady at the drive thru saw my cuts and look disgusted. I want to hurt myself to know that I still feel. I want to die, but I can‚Äôt ever bring myself to finish it; I held my pistol to my head numerous times last night and decided to cut instead of shoot. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the better option. 

I know I‚Äôm rambling, but I need someone to talk to about all this. I know those two things don‚Äôt sound like a reason to hurt myself, but they are just compactions to a lifetime of depression, when things were finally starting to look up for me. ",suicide

56875,"It never ends...About 11:45pm I took my medication (Latuda, for bipolar disorder) as usual (I try to take it around 11:30pm but unfortunately I sometimes forgot--not sure if this ties in or not) and was fine for about 20 minutes. I then (~12:05am) had a wave of severe nausea. I instantly launched into a panic attack. I tried to calm myself down because I was very aware of why I was panicking, but it snowballed. I had not taking Klonopin at all today so I thought maybe I was having a withdrawal, and since I was panicking, what was the harm in taking some? It just takes so long to kick in that it doesn't really help with panic attacks. I couldn't stop freaking out so I took Zofran for the nausea to see if that would quell some anxiety after the fact. About 20 minutes later (~12:25am) I was sobbing in the shower, incredibly upset and trying to ground myself but I couldn't focus. I don't know what happened.

I fear the suffering will never stop, as I frequently have panic attacks and feel sick to my stomach--which, long story short, has traumatized me in the past--and that makes me question life. I have little to no quality. I have not been able to see my therapist for over a month now. I'm not sure it would help anyways. Once a week is not enough, nor does it really solve my problems, though I do enjoy her company. I see a psychiatrist monthly for medication changes but that doesn't seem to be helping either.

48868,"I feel rejected by the system and I don't know where else to turnI don't really know where to start, because I feel like I've been on this roundabout for a little while now. I dealt with a fair bit of bullying and family issues (divorce, DV) as a child/young teen. This made me feel quite anxious for a few years and this is where I first started with psychology. It really helped me for a while, but the anxiety slowly faded away and was replaced by depression.

I'd say for about three years now, I've been really depressed. It's hard to tell, because you don't really know how bad it is until you're through it, I guess. 2017 has been horrible for me. It's been difficult to do anything, so my grades have slipped really badly. I've tried to kill myself four times this year, all with some form of drug and alcohol. It's usually messy, but I guess when you're that impaired that you don't have a filter, it gets a lot messier when you say things you regret to family and friends.

I deserve it, but now most of my family and friends have desserted me too. I don't blame them, because honestly, I've been horrible. The last time I tried was about three months ago now. It was at my university campus, and there were posts to the facebook student group while I was in my impaired state. I didn't intend on doing that nor do I know why I did. The result was that I was found after a goose chase with security and was arrested and taken to hospital.

Of course, it was just like the other times. I was drunk, so they assume I wasn't really depressed and that I was horrible for doing what I did. I was placed in a room and I wasn't allowed to see anyone or have my phone. I had to beg a doctor for help, and that was when I finally got some antidepressants. (I'd been on them before, but it was too expensive to keep seeing my psychiatrist.)

I was finally released and it turns out I sent some pretty embarrassing and inappropriate emails to one of my favourite lecturers who I really looked up to. That really made me upset by putting someone in that position. I've apologised and since haven't got a response (even though I know he shouldn't have to -- it's a professional setting, you know?) even though he said he's always there to talk if I need it. It really hurts because even though he was purely a teacher, he was one of the few people that I really trusted and I felt was there for me. Depression makes you get attached to people I guess.

The posts were visible to everybody, so whenever I step on campus, I get a lot of bullying about it now, too. So I'm too scared to go back. I know my mum has had it to, because last time we fought she said she was too tired of worrying about me and that I should just do it because she needs closure. I know she didn't mean it, but it really hurts.

But the worst part is the hospitals. I'm always treated like a criminal. I'm always hated by the nurses and doctors. And I stress so much about previous experiences there that I can hardly bring myself to go to a doctor, or talk to a counsellor just in case I say something too worrying. I feel completely rejected by the medical people that are there to help, as well as everybody who has said they care.

I've been on these new medication for about three months now. I feel less depressed -- I can get up in the morning and stuff like that. But the suicidal urges are still here. They're so strong, I have to self harm just to get rid of them. I'm so worried about it. And the worst part is that I know if I do it again, I'm going to make sure that I succeed because I can't deal with the hospital again. 

I'm worried that I'm going to hurt myself. I don't want to, but I don't see any other option at this point.

If it wasn't for my girlfriend and parents I would have killed myself sometime ago. I just lost the point to live life because all I see in the future is stress and bills and depression. What's the point?

I have nobody to talk to. I cut off contact with the one friend I had because she was being abusive, but I can't even remember if she actually was abusive or if I just convinced myself that she was.

I know I should see a therapist, but every therapist I've seen has ended up treating me like shit or tried to commit me to an extremely abusive mental institution. I can't even talk to anybody I know because I'm scared they'll tell my parents and my parents will have me committed for the 72 hour holding period bullshit that turns into a 2 week stay.

Family is embarassed of me.I have always been living for family, now I am getting to the point where I wonder how long I can live before giving up, because its exhausting and my will weakens. 

There are too many people in the world and the country i am in is also overpopulated. One death out of many wont really impact, and even if I stay alive, I will be useless and leave a meaningless life being a burden to everyone. 

I know my family is embarassed of me, but I also know that they still love me. Even my small sister thats like 14 is fine with my elder or small brother dropping her to school or so, but if its me and noone else is available, she doesnt want to be seen by me, even though at home she interacts the most with me and messes with me. 

I also am sure that any friend or anyone in my life around me will always be embarassed to be seen with me, I am a mess and mess up at everything and I dont deserve to be alive and live. I also do not want to be alive, I dont want to feel, I just want an end, I dont care if I go to hell, I dont care about life after death or not. I just want an end. My family didnt deserve someone like me to be born. I wish I could be replaced and someone else could take my place in my family. I know that besides family love, I will never have any other and even if someone claimed to love me, I could never believe them and feel like they would eventually leave me, cheat on me and things like that. I hope I get kidnapped and killed or run over by some car someday.

Things that are contributing to my depression:


- I'm a 19 year old female studying full-time at my local community college, due to my inability to work because of my busy school schedule, my boyfriend (21) had to pick up a 50/hr a week job with a one hour commute in order to support us, So he's gone now for 14/15 hours a day 4 days a week, 16/17 hours if there is really bad traffic. I barely see him now. He contributes to a lot of my happiness. 



- I'm going for a doctorate so I won't even be done with school until I'm 27, and then I'll have to deal with several thousands dollars in student loan debt. I feel such an immense amount of pressure to have a showy career and make an overwhelming amount of money because I grew up incredibly poor with a broken family, in which my dinners either consisted of a handful of otter pops or a $1 Mr.P's pizza split between my two siblings and I. 



- My boyfriend and I have been together for four years now and were considering eloping next year or the year after, and now I'm scared that i'll get cut off from fafsa If we do so, because it'll change my status to an independent.  


- I have no ""girl-friends"", I have tried everything, friendsmatch,  girlfriendsocial, not4dating, strictly platonic forum on craigslist, local subreddits. Nothing has worked. 



- I have no health insurance, constantly fearful that i'm sick or dying and have no idea. 



- Sometimes the only ways to get me out of suicidal thoughts is to place myself in a daydream where I have endless money and nothing to worry about, I find myself living in these fantasies more and more lately. 



- I'm growing increasing terrified of where I live, Someone has been stealing my mail for the last month, a man was murdered on my street a few weeks ago, and a hole was shot in my window with a BB gun, my only form of security is my German Shepherd. 

- Constantly struggling with anxiety and body dysmorphia, I'm thin now, but can't stop seeing the zit riddled fat kid in the mirror. 

- I've been having horrible nightmares every night for well over 4 months, so I've been avoiding sleep. The most I've gotten in a single night since this started is 5 hours of rest. It's really starting to have a physical effect on me, having back and side pain along with some killer dark circles on my face. 

- The ever growing thought that all of this can go away if I just kill myself, or attempt to go off-grid. I'm terrified of dying, yet feel sometimes like it's the best option to avoid pain and disappointment. ",suicide

Each person you know gets a slice of your personality so there's never any real catharsis when you talk to someone. No one really knows anybody. Everybody knows this stuff on some level, it's just cliches. But they've earned their status as cliches because they're fucking true. I don't have a gun or reliable pills. I've got that sharp knife though. I bought it when I was 17 and had to lie and tell that old Chinese lady I was 18. It seemed like a cool thing to have at the time.

I just don't want it to hurt. If I slit my wrists it seems like it'll fucking hurt. I think maybe if I slit my throat it would be quicker and then I wondered whether or not it would hurt more if I slit my Adam's apple open. Maybe I could slice it low below there so that they could hide it with a tie at my funeral--why cause my parents anymore grief, eh?

It's not like I didn't try to deal with this stuff. I imagined shooting my head and being jolted out of lethargy for one quick terrible second before head exploded. Then I imagined that if I failed somehow I would be saying all of these things to a psychologist. ""No, I don't think I'm bipolar doc--never had the manic shit. I don't even think I have clinical depression."" Then the image of the doctor turned into a professor I fucking hate and I imagined telling that red-headed cunt off. ""I hope your granddaughter dies in a fucking car fire."" She's the kind of person who would have a quick witty response though. She wouldn't even be fazed by me. No one is, in a good way or bad. The best I can accomplish is to creep people out. I try hard to compensate how awkward I am with niceness and the niceness comes off a contrived bullshit and scares people, makes them wonder why I'm being nice. Fucking hell, I'm just trying to make things easier for YOU, folks. 

I don't know. I just can't believe how all of these things in my head just disappear into...what? Blackness? That's a color, even black can't describe the amount of nothingness my thoughts will dissolve into. I don't know if I can keep going on. If I die than that's a pretty shitty scenario but if I live then I'll just end up posting on here again or venting in some place like this. If I don't have a place like this to vent I'll just go into the world inside my hide and have imaginary conversations with psychologists and try to imagine their halves of the conversation or I'll talk to people in the past who made some kind of impression on me who don't even know I'm around anymore, can't remember my name, don't think about me ever. 

I know I'm rambling but I'm afraid to stop because when I do I have to either kill myself or go on living and I don't fucking want to do either right now. I'm cold.

My story begins back in december of last year as for the date I forgot, anyways my friends and family all were giving me a hard time that December I had finals to take, projects to complete; but to no surprise my family was the first to make me want to end it all by making me doubt myself saying I will never amount to anything. ""You aren't the little girl we needed your only still here because its too late to get rid of you"" said my father that night as he threw me to the ground knocking the air out of me. My mom giving me false love warming up to me ""I'm so sorry I love you sweetie"" one minute, the next minute her yelling to me I shouldn't be alive and trying to gouge my eyes out. And at this time my crush was there for me she heard what I had to say and made me feel ok to cry because I don't like to cry for anyone. So that night I messaged her how I felt and told her I'm only telling her just now is because I overdosed on my medication (ambien) and didn't think I'd wake up after I fell asleep. My eyes were already getting heavy but I remember reading this on the screen before I fell asleep ""don't you die on me, if you wake up and go to school tomorrow I'll give you the biggest hug. So wake up please for me I love you"" after reading it I felt at peace and happy to hear it from her I didn't notice it but shortly after I woke up at nearly the same time I went to sleep. For some odd reason I thought I time travelled I try to turn on my phone to see the date but its dead. I looked all over the house I was alone to make it even more sad I share a room with my brother and he didn't even bother to check if I was ok. I found a note that said my family went out to eat and I was expected to clean the house up, which wasn't new my family always excludes me in alot of things but still I amxious to get my phone on when it turned on I saw she sent more messages asking if I'm awake yet or if I'm at school today. Smiled and felt relief but also sad that I could have died and my family wouldn't have noticed. The rest is not important I was manipulated by her we were dating I solely gave my life to her she cheated on me with multiple men some who are much older and sending her nudes it crushed me so I didn't go to school for a week when I did go and she saw me and tried messaging me I didn't go for another 2 weeks.

Just need to do a brain dump now and get it out thereI'm a male in his 30s, successful, healthy, people tell me they think i'm doing really well. I think almost everyone would be surprised to hear I am thinking about suicide. The last few years I have been planning my exit. I don't know when exactly i will do it, but probably before I turn 40.

My friends are all married and having children, I am meanwhile trudging along trying to make new friends and stay involved in something outside of work. I go to the gym a lot, I read, I have hobbies, I travel, I even moved across the country. I can improve lots of things about my life. I am a proud person and I am not helpless. Still i have no close friends that understand me and want to hear about what I am going through. If I even hint at being depressed I get the old ""chin up, tough guy"" or people just stop calling. I also have very bad relationships with my family. I have one sibling and we will probably never speak again. Not close with my parents. I had one serious girlfriend, but we broke up years ago and I have not tried a serious relationship since then. Lots of flings and short term dating, but nothing serious and I don't think I could ever be in a relationship again.

I just cannot fathom a reason to keep living other than sheer momentum and the will to live. I rarely experience any joy. I just work.. either at my actual job, or on hobbies and side projects, I am constantly working. The thing is, I like working. It gives me a purpose. Otherwise I feel like life is pointless. I have to make something out of my life. What else is there to do when you are my age? Dating is like torture to me. Everyone i meet on a dating site is just looking for someone to buy them dinner and drinks and show them a good time. I feel objectified and I never feel a connection. Sex is meaningless sensory stimulation. I enjoy it on a primal level but it leaves me feeling empty. The only thing I can offer women is sex or the superficial ""stability"" that women in their 30s want, basically to have a house and a car, the trappings of a ""successful life"". But that isn't what I want. I want to live a real life. I want somebody who likes books and doesn't care about bullshit. I have almost completely given up on women at this point, I'm tired of getting burned, and I don't want to date anyone i don't have a connection with.

My sole hope in life is to somehow make that connection. Otherwise, i think I am doomed to a life of working and striving for no reason, for decades and decades, until I am too old to work and i become useless. I can keep plucking away at some of my 'goals' for the rest of my life and maybe make some casual acquaintances, friendly neighbors etc., but am I so crazy to think this isn't good enough? What is the point of becoming really smart and strong and talented and wealthy and amazing if there is no one else around and it's just you in a room alone?

I don't want that to happen to me so I have started planning my exit. I don't feel happy about this but it seems like the only way to have dignity in the rest of my life. I don't want to be around for those decades alone. It will be torture. I am going to give myself another 5-6 years and make sure I have my ducks in a row so I can exit early if it seems like nothing is going to happen.

The worst part is I can't tell anyone about this because I will be insulted and have them tell me i'm being a selfish cunt or that I'm just being ""dark"" for even thinking about giving up my perfect life. Nobody understands, i am completely alone in this world, and it looks like I always will be.

63752,"The family I thought I had is completely falling apart.When I was younger, life wasn't bad at all. I didn't start out in a troubled home, or at least that's what I always thought. I had two loving parents that actually supported me and wanted the best for me, but a lot can change in a matter of 21 years.

My parents got divorced when I was in the 3rd grade. My dad moved about 30 minutes away with his new wife (girlfriend at the time) and would initially come to visit me every once in a while. It eventually got to the point where I'd only see him once a year -- at Christmas time -- and now I haven't seen him in fuck knows how long. There are times when I actually forget that he's still alive, if I'm completely honest.

My mom, on the other hand, is a control freak. If it's not going her way, it might as well not be going at all. She constantly criticizes the choices I make: from the people I call friends to the fact that I use alcohol, cigarettes, and cannabis to ease my mind when the daily routine and my assignments are done. I'm a college student, so I (unfortunately) still live at home. I had some old vaping shit and cigarettes in my room at one point, and my mom decided to go through my stuff one day and threw everything out: easily about $100 right there, all things considered. She's also thrown out a bong, pipe, stash container, and about 3 grams of weed on a separate occasion: well over $100. She's within her legal right to do this since it is her house, but it doesn't change the concept that she's actively throwing away money that I've earned (I do have a job). I've obviously gotten pissed about that fact, but there's no reasoning with her at all. If I try to compromise on anything, she won't have it. If I get mad about the fact that she can't be reasoned with, she literally calls up her whole side of the family and plays the victim to them, one at a time. At one time, she also disapproved of a girl that I was dating so much that she would take my car keys and have my fucking grandma drive me to class/work so that I couldn't go visit said girl. I wish I was joking. Despite all of this family drama that she insists on starting for no fucking reason, she actually thinks that I'm going to attend family holidays this year. I've already told her that she can forget about that, and she -- as usual -- plays the victim there as well. As far as she's concerned, she can do no wrong. Even when she's trying to make my life decisions for me and throwing away my possessions that I worked for, I'm apparently the one who's at fault.

I've grown to hate the family that I always thought would support me and the choices I make, I hate coming home at the end of the day, and I have a general dislike for being alive at the moment. My desire to be away from home has gotten so bad that I'll occasionally go to Walmart and walk around the store, or I'll go to a local park with a coffee and a pack of cigs so that I don't have to go back yet. If I have assignments to do, I'll sometimes do them on campus so I can postpone going home. There are also times when I'll do an extra hour or two at work just so I don't have to go home too early.

The only thing that's keeping me going at this point is the hope that everything will eventually get a whole lot better, or that I'll get my hands on some harder drugs that'll kill me and then I won't have to deal with any of this shit anymore. Honestly, I don't care which one happens; I just want it to hurry up. Life, in its current state, simply isn't bearable.",suicide

68335,"I‚Äôve been depressed for yearsWhen I was in high school I loved basketball and was pretty good at it. Enough to make varsity as a freshman and to go on to play college basketball. I loved basketball and wanted to be a coach and a teacher. Well I moved 10 hours away from my hometown to the college and this was probably a bad choice. My freshman year in college I fall in love with Jamal and everything‚Äôs perfect. Fast forward to the summer and he‚Äôs secretly living in my apartment with me. This is when he starts abusing me, mostly mentally at this point but he is manipulative and would steal my car and go hangout with other girls. School starts again and I move into my first house with my two best friends and of course Jamal... we start fighting and my roommates hear it. He actually gets physical with me and chokes me out while holding me up against a wall. My roommate sees the marks on my neck and locks me in her room with me and begs me to call the cops but I refuse because at this point I‚Äôm pregnant but I don‚Äôt tell anyone except Jamal. Jamal and I eventually have to move out and get an apartment that I pay for because I forgot to tell you he dropped out our freshman year and never got a job. I‚Äôm pregnant so I decide I have to quit the basketball team the only thing keeping me from Jamal 24/7... so I quit and I lost my two best friends. A month after I quit basketball I miscarry and it just kills me at this point. So I stay with Jamal another two years until the end of my junior year and finally move back home away from him. I spent three years being manipulated, abused and lied too. I felt so beaten down I took a year off college to just get back to myself. Well I haven‚Äôt been able to and I have just been a shell of my former self. Basketball was my favorite thing in the world and he managed to take that and my friends didn‚Äôt want to be around me with him around. I just lost everything for a boy I was totally in love with.

My mom also had a similar situation in which she got pregnant and married the guy but he turned out to be a POS and cheated and lied and all of this stuff. Well my brother is 3 when she finally gets him completely out of the picture and meets my dad who later adopts my brother.

So fast forward to last night and someone lost the remote to my fire stick my parents are trying to watch. I tell my mom there‚Äôs an app on her phone she can get that will work it. She gets upset because she downloaded a knockoff and not the real app and it won‚Äôt work. She starts screaming about how if I didn‚Äôt sit at home all day watching TV the remote wouldn‚Äôt be missing. We are a cut deep with our words kind of family (which is why I probably didn‚Äôt think anything was wrong with Jamal). My mom and I start arguing more intently. I call her a bitch. She tell me she wants me to move out and stay away from her because Jamal ruined me and I can‚Äôt be fixed and that why nobody likes you and always leaves. Now mind you I have no friends only family who invites me places as a second thought most of the time so what my mom said was probably true. They don‚Äôt like me around anymore. So I‚Äôve made the decision to keep to myself and save money I‚Äôve made from my contractual job. I just want to be happy again like I was in high school but I think I need therapy but my parents won‚Äôt pay for it and don‚Äôt want me fixed they just want me gone. So I can‚Äôt wait until I save up enough to move out and actually find someone to help me put my pieces back together. I figured of all people my mom would understand falling for the wrong guy but all it did was ruin me and my life and so that‚Äôs my fault and I don‚Äôt get any help. 

This was more of just a rant than anything. I did sit in my parents bedroom holding a gun wondering if this is the kind of gone I should be but I decided that no it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm going to start my own life without my parents and when I fix myself by myself and have grandkids they are never going to meet them. Why would I want my kids around someone who would just let their kids suffer in pain and depression? And then hate on them more because they have depression?",suicide

I want to believe that mankind is just a long developed form from a single cell-- but I just can't escape the subjective impact of my life.

I was accepted to transfer into a relatively prestigious university for my desired major. That was good, but for some reason I felt no satisfaction, despite having worked hard for it. 

My girlfriend and I of 14 months recently broke up. It‚Äôs been 4 months now, but I really miss her. We didn‚Äôt have a bad breakup either, it was just the fact that we were attending different universities across the entire country (she‚Äôs a year younger than me so she wasn‚Äôt in uni yet). I can‚Äôt stop thinking of her, she really was the perfect girlfriend. 

Right now I work a job that I absolutely hate. It‚Äôs 40 hours a week and pays decent but it‚Äôs dangerous and physically taxing. I want to quit but my parents threaten to kick me out of the house if I do. I don‚Äôt have anywhere else to go. 

Idk maybe the general ambiance of the world doesn‚Äôt help. 

I have long held the belief that life is primarily suffering and it is broken up with intermittent moments of happiness, not the inverse. That kinda led me to the belief that in some scenarios suicide can certainly be rational and lack moral culpability. 

That leads me to the thought process that if I have no one who cares about me and I decide to suicide, it‚Äôs not wrong and may even be objectively correct. 

That thought process coupled with my own negative emotions have caused me to grow increasingly suicidal :(

I haven't really had friends since middle school, and have always had trouble in regards to social interaction. While I have improved a bit, it's still almost impossible to connect to anyone. I feel worthless, like I have no personality. It feels like when I talk to my parents or family in general, that they only love me because they're supposed to. I know that's likely not true, but that's what my mind is telling me. I constantly feel like a burden. I feel like I've never impacted somebody's life, like I'm just existing. I'm so lonely. I have all these things I want to talk about with people, but connecting with anyone is impossible. 

I know none of this is a healthy way of thinking and that I probably need to see a doctor or a therapist, but I feel like they wouldn't really care. I wish I could tell my parents, but they're very Christian, and they know I don't go to church so I feel like they'll just tell me I'm depressed because I'm a bad Christian. I've also gone to them before in distress, thinking something was wrong with me, but they only responded saying that nothing was wrong with me and that I just need to do something to cheer myself up. I want to get better, but I hate feeling vulnerable, and I feel like I'd be burdening people with my problems, or that they'd be judging me for being such a loser. I'm failing three of my classes right now, and haven't gone to a majority of my classes in months. Most of the time I can't even get out of bed. I'm such a failure.

I'm sorry, I know this is all jumbled, but I feel like I'm about to explode. I've coped with it for a while, but recently I've been constantly thinking of hanging myself. The only thing keeping me from doing that is the thought of how much it would scar my roommate and impact my family. But I don't know how long I can keep doing this. I don't see myself having a future or ever having a friend or somebody to talk to. I don't see myself ever becoming a normal adult with a job and a house or apartment. I just wish I never existed in the first place.",suicide
53313,"This is the end, my only friend, the end.I was wandering a graveyard once, and there was a gravestone of a young man that read ""He was a testament to himself.""  Beautiful sentiment, eh?  Well, he's my testament to the end of my life, because nobody in my life will be saying or thinking ""He was a testament to himself."" after I'm gone.

I'd like to the jump of the Golden Gate Bridge: one grand gesture for an otherwise lackluster life.  I doubt I can wait a week for a cheap one-way fare, but who knows.  Would give me time to tie up the loose ends of my existence.  In my case, loose ends means unloading a massive collection of books to show for my pathetic life.  At times these books where my saviors, my friends, my life, but now they are just part of the heavy burden of accumulation.

The boring biographical breakdown: 27, gay male, jobless, without health insurance, broke, massive debt, failed out of college multiple times, abused as the child of a single parent, chronically depressed, on and on.

Before this point, I tried to make some sense of this thing called life, but I am tired of suffering.  I've read countless books on Buddhism, philosophy, self-help, and spiritual books.  I've filled journals with my feelings and bad poetry; I've been in therapy on and off for 11 years; I've tried various combinations of meds; I've called suicide hotlines, and I always wind back up at this point: wanting it to end, permanently.  I'm tired of trying, tired of existing.

So there you have it: the last testament of a life that was a perpetual grinding of gears, until -- I have finally had enough and am throwing myself on the gears to get the horrible machine to stop, break.

I understand that everyone's got lives to live and whatnot, but what I don't get is how people can regard suicidal thoughts and depression with the same indifference as the temperature of a room. In a way it's almost worse when people do care, because then you hear bullshit like, ""Just be cheerful!"" or ""You're as happy as you decide to be!"" Like people choose to be depressed. They think it's just some switch you can flip on or off, and they're ignorant of how hard you're actually trying. ""Hey, I didn't lay in bed all day hating myself, can you give me some credit?"" 

I don't know. I was hospitalized over a decade ago (I got in an accident, I didn't make an attempt at my life) and the nurses told me I had a prayer list of forty people or more. That made me feel good, people happy that I still existed. I know there are people that care about me, but it just feels so indescribably lonely sometimes.

I tried to change my life around and go back to school and covid fucked those plans. I have 2 online friends and nothing more. Never met them, but I am grateful for them. But God I am so lonely. I tried making friends at work but I'm mostly ignored.

Romantic life is non existent. I haven't kissed or been held in 13 years, how sad. I tried meeting people online and that goes no where. Sex life has always been non existent thanks to sexual abuse as a child. Whenever I do think I find someone, they just use me as a place holder until they find something better.

Man I just want to be seen for who I am. I try to always be supportive and kind and that shit gets you no where. Being an unattractive woman makes you invisible. I have so much love to give and no one wants it.  I want a chance to be a mom and wife but I'm pretty much running out of time.

I'm going to be 30 next month and some part of me always felt like I'd be dead before 30. Maybe it's time to take that and run with it. I don't want to hurt my parents, they have been good to me. I don't want to leave my dogs and cats.

64243,"My dad‚Äôs been a dick to me for such a long time and has expected me to still be happy to come over to his house. Should I just hit fuck it and give him shit until he stops? So for the longest time my dad and I have not gotten along. I have divorced parents and I have to go over to his house every other weekend. For the past year things have really taken a turn for the worse. He just talks without thinking, becomes rude when talking about my mom, and is annoyingly homophobic. Most recently, he backed into my car (that he had no place in buying at all) and when I came out to see, I said something like ‚Äújesus christ.‚Äù Mind you, this was directed at the damage, not him. I went inside and he then said that the insurance company had it all under control. He went on to say that my reaction was out of line and that he has never seem someone so immature. On top of this, once I got my car fixed he then told me to thank him for hitting my car because the car now looks better (it looks the same). I jokingly said I don‚Äôt think I will, and he further decided to take it seriously. Not only this, but there have been countless times where he‚Äôs just casually judgmental about everything. Some time last year I told him I didn‚Äôt want to come over anymore, but now he just acts like that never happened. In fact, he acts like nothing ever happens and then makes me out to be this neglecting ass. He‚Äôs also the reason I will never go out of the country as a minor, because he believes that my mom would ‚Äústeal me‚Äù which makes no legal sense.   

So, the thing I have to ask is if I should just shut him out completely until he changes? I had this plan earlier today to just stop talking to him entirely or be honest when he asks in his cutesy way about hanging out with him?

48979,"Probably going to end it all this year 

I am younger than 18y old and haven't ended school yet. I am a straight male, and live in Brazil

Since the last week, I've realized how ugly I am and I believe I'll never date anyone. I consider me and my life boring, so even if someone gave me a chance, I probably would screw it up. Pathetic.

Most of my friends were from school and moved to another school this year. I've made new friends (all classmates), but sometimes I think they talk with me out of pity, because I'm alone in class.

My philosophy is ""I want to make everyone sucessfull and happy because I probably will never be"". So, when my friends are happy, I don't talk about my problems.

Today I was thinking about killing myself. My two best friends will move to another school next year, so I was thinking to end it all in the end of the year, not in front of anyone, 'cause I don't want anyone to get traumatized. I wanted to be a medic, but I don't think I am smart enough.

The two things that made me proud: My grades and my jokes, don't make sense anymore. Recently, i have started to get bad grades at some subjects, and my jokes seem to get unfunnier every day. Sometimes people laugh but I think it's just to make me happy or because they're in a good mood.

Most of my classmates are girls, so I don't know how much I can bond with them without it looking like I want to date everyone. (Btw, I had a crush on a friend of mine (also a classmate), but everytime I looked at myself on the mirror, I thought: ""She will never want you, nobody will, not even you would date yourself, so I'm trying to forget that.)

I'm too much of a coward to ask my father to hire a shrink (he's already spending lots of money with me). I think he believes in my dream of becoming a medic, but I don't believe myself.

My own mind tells me that I am pathetic, and everything I think has two versions: Optimistic and Pessimist, first, I see everything in an optimistic way, but then my mind remembers me that none of that will ever happen.

Once, a guy (ina n YT video) said: ""remember the hug of the person you love the most, you would lose that if you suicided"", but I haven't hugged anyone in a while, I tend not to make too much physical contact with my friends, as most of them are girls.

The thing that hurts me the most is that people believe in me, so I want to make it look like an accident, because then, at least someone will think ""he could've made it"", instead of being frustrated by me.

You, (if anyoneis even reading this) can call me Gabriel. I really don't know what to do, I only cry in the shower and when I'm alone, because I don't want my father to hear it.

There are a lot of problems in my life and issues I should take care off, but in the end, it doesn't matter, I will die anyway. This mindset is basically the best I can hope for. It gets really bad, when I develope ideas about, how I actually care about certain thing or that tehre are things I would like to experience/achieve. When this happens, all the problems I could just ignore and deem irrelevant crash me with an intensity I couldn't even imagine, when I'm in this comfortable place of total apathy.

I don't want to have these feelings, the biggest task of self-preservation I'm able to perform is stuffing food in my mouth and not even that reliably. I want my brain to understand, that these things can't be dealt with and the things it wants in these moments are unachievable.

She's blaming it on my dad for yelling at her, and for her not liking her room. I understand she's probably a bit traumatized from my dad yelling at her to get out of bed and my mom just being absent and focusing strictly on work. My dad and my mom dont have a good relationship as it is, so when my dad yells the tension just rises. I try to be there for my sister and i thought we had a good enough relationship for her to want to come to me when shes sad but i guess its not like that. Every time i try to talk to her when shes in a depressive state, she says nothing to me. I try to get her engaged and talk to our friends, since we share a friend group, but she is always focused on the idea that our friends never reach out to her. Along with this, I don't feel comfortable telling any of my friends or my boyfriend any of this for numerous reasons. My friends are nice and i like them alot, but me telling things to them might mean they tell my sister that im gossiping about her to them and she would flip out if she found out about that. When I try to talk about this to my boyfriend, he turns the tables onto himself and starts to talk about his problems and leaves me sadder than before. Its a long distance relationship, so communication is key and i know that, but its so hard to tell him that he is hurting me because he will turn into the ""im such a horrible boyfriend"" or the ""you should just break up with me"" and i really feel bad after that. I mentioned it once before and we had to work through it for a week, and i'm not sure how i would tell him that. He also tends to bring up my not so perfect dating history and all the reasons that he shouldn't trust me, which makes me feel like absolute garbage.

54915,"Just need some advice to stop feeling depressed and suicidal...So yea. I'm suicidal at times, but thankfully I'm much better now...

But still, I feel depressed almost everyday. I don't know why sometimes. I guess you could say, one of my closest friends started ignoring me in early 2011. I became really depressed, broke down in school non-stop. But I survived and I'm glad for it.

It gets lonely now though. I've no real person to talk to... to tell stuff to, no people to give me advice. I can't really blame my rl friends because most of them don't go through what I go through. My parents argue everyday, or rather my mum just throws her temper around for no rhyme or reason. The pressure's on me. Because I'mthe oldest, I'm expected to get good grades, expected to do what I have to do...

My grades suck, and I'm really confused as to what my heart really wants. To continue in JC or move to poly?

Sometimes, it gets so bad that I feel like cutting. But then I'm too scared to do it, so it's alright. I feel like I've no purpose in life, no direction, I'm only living because I've to live.

I know I'm really fortunate compared to some people out there, but the negative thoughts keep coming. No matter how hard I try to stay happy. And it‚Äôs just hard when sometimes all you wanna be is a different person, live in a different world, and be able to do what you really want to do without being scared. 

And it hurts whenever I see that friend helping others and not caring/not even aware of what is happening to the people who really care about him/her.

I appear like a really cheery, happy girl in school... but deep down though some of my friends know how depressed I get, no one knows the extent of my depression or suicidal thoughts...

They all think I'm better now. But I'm not. I'm still just as insecure, just as weary, just as tired and sick of the world around me. I'm not sure whether I'll be able to fully trust anyone again.

Some days, I feel like I'm drowning, like there's no one to save me. And sometimes, I just wish that maybe I'll accidentally be in the way of a vehicle on the road someday, or just drift away and never wake up forever.",suicide
51932,"I'm seen as a Drone for society to peg me up the ***All we are are drones to be used to keep society some-what functioning for the big boys up on top of that pyramid. It's human nature for humans to fuck over other humans for personal gain, and now it's going so far to the point where institutions and corporations around the world are destroying our beautiful planet for short term gain.

It's awful, we're doomed, we're completely fucked. No one has a drop of empathy for the home planet of their own species. Everyone turns a blind eye towards faith to God, the government, or maybe a bit of both. Everyone is so ego centric, giving up a little bit of convenience or modifying their culture in any way at all to help out the planet is just too much to ask from most people. 

We're in the midst of a mass extinction and the only thing anyone gives a shit about is money, social status, or other stupid shit feeding into their overweight ego. We're the most intelligent species on the planet. We are the care givers of the planet, not some magical fairy God that loves everyone. This is humanity's last stand, and history repeats itself once again, one last time.

My first job at fast food, I was kept labeled as a worker in training for the whole four months just so they can pay me less to do all the grut work like cleaning all the stoves and dishes everyday while other chilled on their phones for down time. 

My second job at a restaurant, my shifts as a dishwasher or busboy would always get cut off to be given to some family members of the restaurant that think it's okay to slack off because they're family and they know they won't get fired.

I just got a third job at a local warehouse, I was told a 300 dollar bonus to help clean the warehouse because it was shutdown for a month or so because of corona. Being the only young worker there, I worked my ass off constantly moving 8 hours a day coming in Saturdays too. I was lied to and given a 100 dollar bonus. He probably pocket the other $200 because I'm so easy to be fucked with. I'm thinking of quiting tomorrow because that's bullshit. 

The American politcal system is a system only designed for two parties to compete but in reality we all know both parties are working together to once again fuck over the people for personal coporate gain. Everyone focuses on the president but not many point out that he's just a puppet with strings to be pulled by the elites. 

I hate my friends because they're all pieces of shit I met in highschool that would never give the slightest shit for what I have to say about anything. Anytime I'm not at home I have to put on the costume society gives me and act nothing like my true self at work or with friends. Maybe I should get better friends that do care about the stuff I say but school is over because I graduated and it's hard to make friends lol. 

Who knows, maybe there is nothing wrong with the world, but there's only stuff wrong with me, but I wouldn't think so. Everyone believes what they cannot see, and everyone looks away from what's really in front of them and deludes themselves for comfort. 

I don't think I'm wrong, I really don't. I think the whole world is wrong and fucked up rather than I am. But then again it's natural for people to always think they're right. I'm thinking I'm correct right now but maybe I'm totally wrong and the world is sunshine and rainbows after all but I doubt it.

It's a shame narcissm over rides empathy in evolution, it is our ultimate downfall. I've been contemplating Suicide for maybe 2 years now and that's not good for how young I am (18). 

The biggest reason why I'm deciding to stick around is because my mother is the only person on the planet that listens to what I really have to say about things and the world. I'm also aware of a mother's natural love for her children and I would never want to cause that much mental pain to the only person who doesn't see me as a cog in the machine. The only person I see that isn't insane or mental. The only person that cares about me. Once my mom goes, I go because then there will be nothing stopping me from escaping this prison evolution forced upon me.

I can see myself killing myself one day, I can't go on for another 30, 40, 50 + years. Who knows if humanity will even live that much longer given the state of the environment and how much technology is increasing. I'd only stick around to see that so I can laugh at how shock people are that it really is the end lmao.",suicide

I have tried so hard to get out, banged on the door, screamed prayed for a life not like this. Now the world is like my life everyday. Stuck at home, because I don't have friends, enough money, or a job or anywhere to go, I watch and wish I had a life. Then my mental illness kicks in and can't go out sometimes because I feel too freaked out in the world or ugly or sad.  The pain is unending. Years and years of this, barely getting by, getting close but the doors shut when hope shines in, I stopped hoping or wishing for anything. I go to the store and come home, pretend I have a normal life. I don't, I am isolated sad and depressed way before this began. I did have a dog but she died, I did have Mom but she died. I am getting older my body and skin is changing and I don't want to be an old person. This life has been torture. Everything is a trigger now a reminder of what a loser I am. Never married, never succeeded, no kids, no money, own very little. Feel left behind and left out, unlovable. Mind you I am grateful, I hate it when people say, ""just be grateful"" you can be grateful and sad. I am thankful for so much, but I hate myself. I want this to end. I don't want to be here anymore. My heart is shattered; I want to be with my Mom and my dog. No one will even know I am gone. I see no future. I can't live like this anymore. I have tried, stayed as long as I can, I want out. I feel so guilty because there are people dying of all sorts of things out in the world who have people who love them and need them, I would give them my life to be released from mine. This quarantine is so ironic. It is the one time in my life that I am not worried about being unemployed, because everyone is in a way.

I've been having these feelings for a while now. For months since I've started my career, a feeling that nobody would care and most would be better off if I was gone and this shows it. 

Why did I have to wake up? I don't have the guts to try it again. In the past 3 months, my friends of many years have left me. I was an idiot to tell people about my issues because that just made them leave.

I don't know what I'm going to do anymore because I have no reason to continue. Everything I cared for is gone now, anyting that meant anything to me. Everything waiting up to this is just been so much and now I get to wake up to losing my last friend and likely my job.

56713,"Well fuck, I just found out that my ex step dad was planning to kill my mom and take me. Not really sure why I'm posting this here, I guess I just need to get it off my chest and I don't want to put this on the people around me so I'm talking about it on the internet.






My mom and ex step dad were in an on and off relationship for years, practically my entire childhood, married twice, we moved states with him 3 times, stuff like that. They had a habit of getting into really nasty fights, I won't go into detail because I don't think anyone particularly cares. My ex step dad was extremely toxic, and kept my mom in his grasp for years, both my mom and I giving him chance after chance thinking that things would turn out okay.




Turns out, our third move of states with him ended in another huge fight. I ended up calling the police on them, and they got there just in time apparently. My ex step dad apparently had a fucking gun loaded and chambered on their bed, my mom had no idea since she was outside just trying to get away from him. He'd apparently been saying stuff along the lines of ""she needs to die"" and ""my family can take care of (my name)""





Neither my mom and I knew about any of what he said nor did we know about the gun. This was around the time I was in the 5th grade, keep in mind. So for *years* we were in the dark until it was brought up when his most recent ex wife started raining hellfire on him for the awful shit he'd done and this shit all came to light.

57807,"Nowhere to goI've suffered from depression and anxiety for a good portion of my life. I'm 19 now, and today I officially feel like I've tried everything. I'm in a particular pickle: Pain in my pelvis (doctors think it's a hernia) that kills me when I stand/walk, so I had to quit my job and have been waiting for a CT scan since October with no painkillers, no income, in my sisters basement. Before all of this I was already having a very difficult time, but now the will to die has never been worse. For months I've tried hobbies (I write a lot and make music, though my mental state has heavily impacted the quality of both since it has become more of a chore than a fun pass time), my sister is 5yrs older than me and has not dealt with her own mental trauma which only causes her to get mad at me for my near zombie like state lately, and I don't really have any friends. I've tried five different therapist who helped slightly, but with my lack of income I have just enough money to feed myself and receive no money from the government. Today I was desperately trying to find someone or something to give me just a fraction of hope, found a website and was told to pay, and I sort of cracked. I've self harmed a decent amount of times, but stopped as December started and it has now been almost three weeks since, but the urge is only getting stronger. My sister does not take me seriously or as an adult, and my mother lives in the southern US (I live in Quebec, Canada).

I feel like the things in my life aren't nearly as hard as some of the other people on here. I get the idea my problems aren't as bad and so i really shouldn't feel this way. But I still do and i don't understand why I can't control it easier. 

I recently broke up with a girl who was my best friend as well. We were like Jim and Pam level friendship and just connected well. Our 4 year relationship ended over text with no real reason other than ""I don't want to, but I feel like i have to."" Long story short, we don't talk anymore and are 2 states away, I've got no other close friend like her, my family is close, but I feel like an outsider, I'm seeing a girl currently who just doesn't click with me, I work a soul sucking job, and now I'm sitting on the floor of this girls house in the living room alone. I feel alone in so many ways. I am empty and hollow and hate this feeling. I can't remember the last time I was actually happy or excited about anything. I remember the feeling. That warm tingly sensation in your chest that just lifts your mood and puts a smile on your face you can't control. I miss that. The only emotions I ever feel anymore are frustration and sometimes sadness. I've felt like I've lost all care and have been floating in and out of days. I barely remember things. I just do things. I know I did something earlier. I walked. But I wasn't there. My body was there, but my mind was just dead. 

I would just like the emptiness to end. The only thing stopping me from driving my car into the river or ODing is how much it would hurt my family or even my ex if she found out. Thinking about that just makes me more sad and frustrated. 

I wanted to type out my feelings and just say something to someone. I know someone will read this, but I guess it doesn't matter if they do or not. I can't commit to talking about it with someone because I just feel weird for saying anything. Posting this hurts enough. Sorry, guys.

My music taste is all over the place, as are my thoughts. I have depression and ADHD, and I'm a paranormal investigator/cryptozoologist. My favorite thing to do is learn. Also 80s movies

My style is also everywhere, but I'm always wearing a pair of Converse and from that you can probably deduce I'm a skater. I'm not necessarily religious, but if that's your thing, then that's alright. Your choice, not mine.

I'll talk to any race, ethnicity, gender, age, etc. If you're somebody who discriminates for any reason, dont dm me. I have no interest in you whatsoever. 

I've mentioned this before, but if you start a conversation with ""hru,"" dont. Tell me about your passion, why your little sister is pissing you off, or how you're gonna change the world. Describe your favorite memory, what home is to you, or who you want to be. I'm here for that.",non-suicide

Ok so I'm going to make this sort of short because I'm typing this on my lunch break

I've been with the same girl for 4 almost 5 years, we both have our issues but recently she was caught cheating on me, she claims this guy made her feel better about her self and provided attention I was no longer giving her. I didn't even try to fix anything or talk to her about it I just dropped her, after a week or so my sexual cravings where going crazy and I knew how easy it would be for me to call her and pretend to put things back together for well, you know.

I got what I wanted but still couldn't stand what she had done to me and my family went against me because they though it was stupid would even still want to mess with someone who cheated on me. My brother told me I needed to get over things and let her go or he didn't want anything to do with me so I let her go.

While In let her go the second time she kind of got the point that I had used her for sex so she went out in spite and fucked a friend of mine.

2 weeks after breaking up with her when my brother gave me the ultimatum I started really missing what I had with her and I really wanted my life with her back because I did actually love her. I told my self I could get over all this and move forward

I took her back the second time , she knew I had done things when I was single she wasn't happy about but she said she would move on to be with me again and have a happy family(oh yea she has a daughter I have been fathering) The first day back my brother stormed into my house because he lives next door and ask me wtf I was doing back with this dumb bitch because he believes she is a user and a manipulator. I told him I loved her and we are going to move past everything. He wasn't very happy about this and has since removed himself from my life completely.

Here is my delima now that you kind of have a small back ground. My brother was my closest relative and because I took her back he hates me wants nothing to do with me and constantly talks trash about my decision. I feel like because of these mistakes she made and had to live with the reality of how decent our life style was then living with her dad again and seeing how much everything sucked without me (words from her mouth) And I felt the same without her..empty alone and constantly wanting to be with her. But I can't stop thinking about my friend that she hooked up with. I think about it sometimes 3 times or 4 times a day . I love her so much but this brings me so much pain I've lost family over a girl I care so much about that fucked a friend of mine and I've contemplated sucide because I can't think of a better way out of my situation.... I can't be without her and it hurts to be with her.. What should I do?",suicide

I recall one time in middle school when my family caught me cutting. My older brother called me a retard. 

I moved out my house with my sister after an argument with my parents who can be verbally abusive. I really hate myself. I wish me and my sister were as close as people think we are. She does not trust me and has her internet friends. She does not need me. I wanna talk to someone but it can't be my family. It did not work out with my roommates so we recently moved back. Now I dont have my own space anymore. 

I dont like anything about myself. The fear of humiliation keeps me from opening up. The fear of rejection keeps me from opening up. I'm turning 28 soon and I've never had a bf/gf. Still a virgin. Never kissed anyone.

I have my irl friend, but he is suicidal as well. I'm also not as close to him as I would like to be. I dont tell him everything. I feel like I dont have any close friends. I have trouble letting people in.

My mom made me feel like an idiot today. I got frustrated and been crying on and off. Been trying to sleep to stop crying. I dont wanna go to work tomorrow. I'm sure my family will tell me I'm being dramatic and to get over myself but I'm feeling really down and suicidal. 

I looked up ways to kill myself but it's all intimidating with the failures. I looked up assisted suicide but it only looks like its for the severely ill.

59074,"My father killed himself, and I was the one to find him. I feel lost and alone 

The last 2 months have been a nightmare. I've always been the steadfast one in my family but I feel as if there is nothing left anymore. At 23 years old I never dreamed that I would have to go through something like this. On march 14, I went to my fathers house to work on a project. After not seeing him all day I went looking for him and found him in his bed, dead, with a gun in his hand. No note, no explanation, no warning. I had all of 3 seconds to turn around and tell my younger brother that our dad was gone. This was 10PM, and for the next 3 hours I spoke with deputy's, the sheriff, I had to call my mother (My parents have been divorced for 9 years), my grandma, and my sister and tell them the same. I was so angry, sad, confused. All I wanted was to be alone. 2 days later I lost my job because of covid-19.

I had to move back to my apartment (I worked at an outdoor education facility and lived on site). I lost my friends, my father, my job. I fell apart. I laid in bed for days at a time. I haven't had a night of sleep without a nightmare in over 2 months. I feel like moving across the country, trying to escape. Every time I pass anything that reminds me remotely of him, even the roads we would drive down together, I feel so sad, and lost. Its like I'm looking for something and I have no idea what it is anymore. There is just a void and I have no idea how to handle it. I'm trying to be so strong for the rest of my family. And every day no matter how hard I try I cannot stop thinking about him lying in his bed, alone, with god knows what going through his mind.

I just can't believe that he would ever leave us without telling us why. He was so happy, so proud. We had planned to go fishing the week after he died. I feel so lost. I put on a face as if I'm okay. I thought I had more friends. I thought more people cared about me. It seems like now they were only around me because of our circumstances that brought us together. I keep thinking back on times when I was surrounded by friends. My summers as a camp counselor, or my highschool days. I just want to go back. I was so incredibly happy and felt so blessed just 3 months ago. And now I go through my days searching for something to be happy about, for a purpose.",suicide

I am 19 years old, and I‚Äôve felt this way for a while now. At least 5 years. 

I am I lost cause. I never excelled in school work or hobbies, never made any meaningful relationships. I‚Äôve set myself up for failure on a fundamental level. Making long-lasting friends is hard and nearly impossible for me, and I have no clue why. 

I was born in a country in europe and have moved back and forth due to my dads job. This has caused me to have an identity crisis. This also forced me to have to make new friends all the time. I was never able to make strong friendships with people, and if I ever returned they would have vanished. Now that I have settled down and started university you would think that it‚Äôd be easier, but no. I feel like there is something wrong with me.

Now with corona things have been impossible to bear. I started seeing a therapist not too long ago but I don‚Äôt think it will help me in the long run. I envy people with strong friend groups, and wish I was in their shoes. Nobody else is to blame for how I am, it‚Äôs all my fault.

All of this has accumulated and left me with a shattered self-esteem, both physically and personality wise. I try to stay occupied, but as my bad thoughts take over I can barely find the energy to do anything, and my grades and facings the consequences of that. 
 
The future I see for myself is bleak, and short lived. I feel like everything is starting to topple over, everything good I have ever had.

The only thing that has kept me from killing myself is my family. I have always seen suicide as a selfish act to those around them, but as the days go by being labeled as selfish and letting all of this end doesn‚Äôt seem like such a bad thing.

I hate how it seems like I'm not good enough and how this one guy is the best of friends with the girl I tried to go for back then.
Not sure what to do. Why are people always seems like they're better than me in girls looks gym anything. I just want to start over, wake up in 2008 where everything took a turn for the worse, use my knowledge on what I have now to make everything right and become the man I could have been. Make a move with that girl I asked advice on how I liked a girl but it was herself the whole time but she thought it was someone else. Then associate with the real friends that invited me out instead of brushing them off. Then not slack off start of high school knowing the full of consequences of just barely scraping by. ",suicide
45938,"Need some help/advice for moving forwardI feel that I have reached an impasse, one where I think I need to get help. I really hate talking about my issues because I feel like a burden and frankly, embarrassed. I'm at the point though where I know I need help, though, so here goes. This could get pretty long, so if you read through it, I really appreciate it.

My life has been pretty bizarre, at least in my mind. Where things started really was in high school. I was a runner and ran competitively. I started to become pretty well known toward the beginning of my sophomore year where I was challenging seniors in races and toward the end of the year I was 2nd or 3rd fastest in the state depending on which race. Into my junior year, I started to win. And win everything. I only got beat a few of times throughout the last two years of high school. I ended up coming away with like 7 or 8 state individual state championships and a state meet record by the time everything was said and done. Now this all seems really trivial, until you start peeling back the layers. When you're at the top for that long, you don't realize that you might have some underlying issues and you can be sure that nobody else knows about them too. I began to pick up on them toward the end of my junior year.

I've always been shy, shy to the point where I didn't know how to make friends. I guess a social anxiety. I had one or two friends in middle school that I hung out with and that was fine with me. Nobody knew about me then. When I began to get really good at racing, I began to have the issue of not knowing who my actual friends were. Sure the buddies I made on the team were good, but I really only saw them during practice. Others began to patronize me toward the end of my sophomore year. It was usually along things like ""How fast can you run a mile?"" ""How fast can you do this?"" ""How are you so fast?"" and it became more frequent. Some people did it because they were legitimately fascinated with my ability. Others did it to spite me out of jealousy, but that was less frequent. Nobody really took the time to get to know me. It was just really empty. I began to think as time went on and after high school, though, is that people assumed because I was so popular that I had all the friends that I wanted, that I was so talented that I was almost untouchable to a lot of them. I wanted friends badly, but nobody seemed to notice. I attempted to make friends with people, and just seemed to drift from friend group to friend group. I was a nerd at heart, which nobody knew because those kids got tortured so I avoided them and looking back I wish I wouldn't have felt so bound by societal norms to go hang out with the other nerds in my class. A lot of the issues I had were of my own doing, but I didn't realize it at the time. And then there were people who wanted to be around me because of my status, but those things didn't last usually. I can't hold a conversation well, so I was usually a bit awkward.

When it came to relationships, I didn't have many, but they lasted a while. The first girl I dated was another talented athlete and she was one of the fastest in the state. It didn't work out because we were a little too different. The other relationship I was in was with a girl I had been friends with for close to five years when I finally asked her on a date. I fell in love with her pretty quickly. Things fizzled out toward the end of my senior year and that was the end of the relationship. I was uber focused on running and I felt it unfair to her to continue the relationship without being able to pay attention to her. At the end of my senior year, I moved states and went to a college in a state nearby my new home.

This is where my social anxiety started to really take a toll on me. My freshman year of college I was having a really hard time making friends. The allure of being in college was intoxicating so I didn't notice anything until the end of that year when I got an injury. I was out for six months. There I began to learn that I have an addictive personality and my social disorders became prevalent. I went through a depression and contemplated suicide a couple times. I had the one thing I had been doing for nearly a 8 years almost every day (running) taken put from under me and nothing to show for it. I started going to parties every weekend but the weird thing was is that I couldn't bring myself to drink. Instead I sat there watching everyone get drunk and wishing I would do that, but couldn't bring myself to do it for fear of it impacting my running, and so I grew to be alone. I went to class then would go home and watch tv. Eventually I began doing nothing at all but sitting and staring at the wall in front of me. I turned to porn and that became an everyday thing, a terrible habit among other things, just to not feel alone. I tried to go to a church group and for a while that helped and I began to get into relationships again, but I didn't realize that I was doing it just to not be alone. By that time I was back to running but that was never the same again. My self confidence had taken a serious hit and I was frankly not used to people patronizing me. I almost wanted it again because at least someone would be saying something to me. My teammates were also very different than I, so it was a culture shock. I made enemies with some of them and decided to transfer schools because I had dug a hole for myself there I couldn't get out of.

The relationship side was just as bad. One girl I legitimately liked ended up dating some other guy because I didn't notice that she actually liked me back. I went to raves and dances and tried to meet girls. But with my conscience, I couldn't do anything sexual. I never slept with anyone. I ended up dating one last girl the last three weeks I was at this school. After I left for winter break I drove 4 hours to her place to meet her family, spend the weekend, and hang out only to have her tell me she didn't want a relationship on the first day I was there.

I visited one school after my decision to transfer and ended up going there. It was a small school and a nice place, and at the time I needed it. I began to deal with some of my social issues, but a new problem arose- everyone was already in their cliques and friend groups after freshman year, and I was the new kid on the block. Nobody knew me, had seen me, or wanted to approach me. I was so scared about messing things up again at this school that I decided to live in an apartment by myself, another huge mistake. I began drifting once again, friend group to friend group. For the next half year I was even further in a depression. The injury I had previously gotten took me out for half a year. I ran for half a year before this transfer. I got injured again about a month after being at my new school. This took me out another four months and I was in a cast on one leg. I ended up getting back into running and into a church group to help me with my issues, afterward. All this time I stayed out of relationships, partly by choice, part by not. I think I was just too shy by this point for anyone to notice me. After the way I was treated by my old teammates at my last school, I was distrustful of everyone. One girl that showed interest in me just wanted a one night stand it turned out so that was another blow to my confidence.

Over the summer I made a point to get myself back in order. I met a girl (I'll call her R) before the summer got over and for some reason I couldn't stop thinking about her.  Maybe it was because I was alone, Idk. But I made a point to get myself squared away before I saw her again. I ended up doing a pretty good job of fixing myself (I thought) and ended up dating this girl for nearly three years. I found out she was extremely controlling and it hurting me a lot. She ended up going to another school after she graduated and we dated about a year before I broke up with her. When it was over, it reopened wounds I hadn't dealt with for almost three years. In this span of time (the last year of dating her) a roommate had died in his sleep from complications with diabetes and a flu. That was a tipping point and made me rethink my priorities. I decided I needed to focus on school and not running. The school I was at was not going to cut it. I transferred one more time and the running friends at my old school have not been able to forgive me for making this life change so they no longer talk to me. So I guess are no longer friends. I needed some stability in my life which was why I transferred. A year after I transferred was when I broke up with R. I began throwing myself at anyone who would take me and started to go into another depression for a few months and shut myself away before I realized what I was doing to myself again. After a while, I knew I needed to get over this breakup and get myself in shape. I decided to not date and focus on school. I began to mellow out. 

It's been two years since this breakup. In that time I shifted my focus in life and feel like I've gotten myself squared away. I began to make friends and be more confident in my abilities and myself as a person. I wanted to get my confidence back, my sense of mind back, just be a normal me again before I got into a relationship again- to be stable before I got close to someone. But with everything, there's been some scars that I haven't been able to get over. I don't feel like I'm date-able anymore. I've gotten better about talking to people, but with girls now I just lock up to the point where my chest feels like it's caving in and my mind goes blank. I'm starting to fall into a depression again on and off, some days are better than others. But this one feels different than the previous depressions because I've consistently contemplated suicide, frequently every week. The rest of my life seems in order, and I have some good friends and buddies all around, but I feel so alone anymore it's hard to get through the day. I'm fine on the outside so nobody notices how lonely I am. My grades are slipping, I'm skipping meals consistently, and it's hard to even get out of bed. I feel ridiculous for typing this all up, but I just need advice or help or something. I'm afraid I might put a gun in my mouth if I don't do something soon. Idk what to do. I'm sorry this is so long.. I just needed to get it out.",suicide

62424,"Orange juice I want to address the weight issue a lot of teens suffer from. Talking from personal experience. I was on the fat side when I was 14, and the bullying was really bad. I was a nerd, so people didn't really find a way to mock me when it came to grades, because I kicked ass, but when it came to weight, oh boi! The first day of P.E class was a disaster, a guy mocked me for having ""man boobs"" and all of the test of the guys followed his lead, even the so called ""friends"". I'm a really sensitive person, so that was enough to completely destroyy confidence, and it kept repeating each time we had P.E, after a few weeks it stopped, but the insecurities have just started. And that year was the worst year of my life, I'm not going to go into details but let's say that I witnessed my dad hitting my mom, my teacher making me sit in from of everyone and talking about how bad of a person I am, and I got a lot of mockery for my weight, plus other stuff. The year ended with a suicide attempt, unsurprisingly. But that was only the start. Next year, I managed to lose 10 kg or 22lbs in a month, it was not a healthy weight loss l, since I was only about 6kg overweight plus losing that much in that short period of time isn't good, I struggled and still struggle with my body image, I lost some other 2kg or 4.5lbs in about a week, my bones became weak, I sometimes fainted, and I experienced a lot of other unpleasant side effects, and I'm still dieting hard to this day. And since I'm a teen and I'm still developing muscle and am still growing in general, it's unhealthy, but I'm already long gone, but you aren't, please, please, and another please, never listen to society. All of what you see of those perfect people on the media is the minority, and most of it is fake anyways. Love yourself for who you are, trust me I thought losing 12kg would make me happier but it made me more miserable than before. Learn to completely accept who you are.

59506,"Lets see if I make it to 20.Where do I even begin... I'll (17F) try not to bore you with details about everything but I've been depressed for the past two and a half years (brought on by the death of my father). I didn't tell a single person until this year, when I told a doctor and started getting help. Recently I told my mom and my tutor at school, also a friend from my class. 

I can't talk about depression. My mom was standing there trying to get me to open up and I was just giving her one worded answers, barely getting my words out and avoiding eye contact the whole time. Then she said something that just hit me I guess, because the next thing I knew I was full on sobbing in her arms (like that kind of crying where you cant even speak, keep hicupping, breathing weird, runny nose). She said everything she could to comfort me, then after that ended I just felt awkward around her again. Like i'd shown too much of myself, even though shes my mom and is like the one person I should be really open with. 

My family think I'm a freak. They really do. I act so strange around my extended family, probably from not knowing them very well and not wanting to make a bad impression, which I usually end up doing because I'm so such a backwards idiot. This has gotten so much worse since my father died, not sure exactly why. You're probably reading this thinking I'm over-reacting, I'm not. I act like a fucking idiot in front of my family, I say stupid things, react inappropriately to situations I'm not comfortable with. 

I'm weird around guys. I don't mean just because I'm a straight girl and I'm shy around people I'm attracted to. (Well I am, but thats a story for another day). I've been like this for as long as I can remember, before I even developed attraction to the opposite sex, being around most men/boys I felt like I had to...sort of prove myself to them? It's like I search for validation when I'm talking to guys but with girls its completely relaxed and normal. With girls, I don't feel the need to make them like me. (Strongly feel like this is linked to my relationship with my parents).

Theres a few more reasons why I don't feel like existing anymore but these are some of the main ones, *some*. I get suicidal thoughts in waves throughout the day, some massive and some a little smaller but painful none the less. At the moment, in my sleep deprived state, I see the way I'm feeling at the moment as drowning. Foot caught on a plant on the bottom of the river so no chance of swimming back up to the surface at this point, though occasionally I manage to get high enough to breathe in a bit of air, feeling the sunlight warm on my face, before being sucked back in and reminded that people like me dont belong under the sun, we have a place at the bottom of the river, where nobody has to see us. 

To put it bluntly I seriously doubt I'll still be here to see my 19th birthday...maybe not even my 18th. The only thing keeping me around is the thought of my mom having to deal with my death but thats not always enough to keep me from planning it.

52398,"Recurring suicidal ideations despite ‚Äúknowing better‚ÄùCreated this account today specifically to post here. 

Throughout my life I‚Äôve had recurring thoughts of suicide despite having a ‚Äúgood‚Äù life. I have many things to be grateful for;

-	I have a well-paying, enjoyable job with good benefits that gives me a sense of purpose 

-	I have family who I *know* loves me

-	I am in relatively good health for someone with my illness (arthritic condition diagnosed at 22)

-	I am fortunate to have a serious education 

-	I have a solid support system 


Why then do I feel this way? It‚Äôs because that, in spite of all of this, I know the pendulum will eventually swing back the other way and for every good thing that happens to me there will be a negative at some point in the future. 

It‚Äôs this cycle, this perfectly natural unavoidable cycle of life that I can‚Äôt stand and that makes me want to just remove myself from it all. Moments that should be joyous and fun are constantly muted because I am too acutely aware of their impermanence. On top of this, I also know that even the most well meaning people who love us will eventually disappoint us in some way. It‚Äôs inevitable and that makes me very sad. 

On top of this, I self sabotage my chances to have fulfilling romantic connections (which is something I would really like to have) because I would rather keep it as some ‚Äúalmost perfect‚Äù unreachable state than allow someone to love me, be their natural imperfect self, and eventually hurt me too. 

I was physically and emotionally abused by my mom growing up and it had all the implications one would think. It negatively impacted my attachment style, it led to suicidal thoughts and self harming as a teen and I have disassociated a lot. I‚Äôve been in therapy throughout my life and it helps, meds just make me feel like a zombie or gain weight. 

I don‚Äôt want to die, necessarily, but I often question how much I want to live. Will my highs ever feel good enough to make up for the lows? I‚Äôve had genuinely good moments but if I‚Äôm being really honest most days pass mundanely. 

What makes this particularly ironic is that I work in health care and am constantly trying to help patients get away from the very feelings I often feel myself.

My parents on the other hand are the ones i really dont care about after what they've done to me mentally. The way they speak to me and the way they argue with me truly is horrible.

Which is true, but them telling me that makes me feel horrible in every possible way.

I don't like to cry in-front of my parents because of obvious reasons. But when a a single tear drops off my eyes they just tell me to ""man up"" and that ""crying is a sign of weakness"".

60503,"Open relationship and my mental healthThis is my first post, so please be kind. And I hope I do not make any errors or repetitions in my text.

I (23F) and my ex-boyfriend (26M) were in a great relationship for a good 6 months. The year had just ended and things were looking good. I wanted to explore my sexuality and also just have at least one female friend in my life. So, I and my ex decided to open the relationship. 

My ex was having a slow time on Tinder and I had already had a couple of dates with two girls. And then one day, I had sex with a girl. At that point, my ex had not met anybody from Tinder. But I asked him that he should too, so we can both enjoying the open relationship. I think where we went wrong was when we didn't decide on any concrete rules about the open relationship because my ex was okay with me doing whatever. 

Then on a Sunday morning, I am at my ex's place and we were about to grab breakfast when he gets a text from this girl who wants to meet up. And he jumped at that opportunity. I felt a little bad because I wanted to hang out with him and not wait at his place while he was with her. Not much happened.  They decide to meet again and I am unsure about my ex's intentions. He keeps telling me he just felt connected to her and wants to see her as a friend. They plan a second date and my ex doesn't check with me if that date or that day is okay with me. Even though, I sound like a hypocrite, I was already feeling a power imbalance and that my feelings were not appreciated.

We had a huge fight on the morning of their second date. And then he reveals that he was lying about seeing her as a friend but he actually wanted more. I was very upset when he said he might see her despite me feeling very vulnerable and suicidal. The day goes by and I want to talk to him. But he got out of work late and is late for the date and he doesn't have time to talk to me. And that's when it all went downhill. I text him and call him and he won't reply to my texts and he decided to meet her even when I wasn't comfortable with it. I go hysterical and can't handle this. I break some things, hurt myself by pulling my hair and cut a little. At this point, I feel very betrayed but also a hypocrite who can't handle her own emotions. He comes back late at night and I am waiting for him at his place and he tells me he had sex with her and he enjoyed it a lot and will probably do it again. And then he has to hold my hands the whole night because I would not stop hurting myself. I was in a lot of pain. My appetite was gone and I couldn't sleep.

To take my mind off of things, I hooked up with a couple of old FWBs before I met my ex and sometimes that would help move the pain away. 

Because I felt that I had double standards, I couldn't ask him to stop seeing her but it was hurting me a lot. My ex starting treating me as a secondary person and stopped giving me attention. He didn't care how fragile I was for those days and kept reiterating how he had done nothing wrong and I was overreacting. They continue to meet each other and in a month's time, they have a special bond and the girl tells him that she loves him and he says it back. My ex also thinks that the fact that I was seeing many people was unhealthy and starts judging me. Sometimes, he would reassure me by saying that I was his main girl and she was his second girl but I didn't trust him anymore. He could possibly be saying the same thing to her. I wanted to break up with him but I didn't have any close friends or family and I felt very very alone. Then one day, he realizes how much he is hurting me and the other girl and wants to break up with me first. I go hysterical again and cut myself very deeply and had to be rushed to the ER. And then I was hospitalized. The thing that hurts me, even more, is that he kept seeing her while I was in the psych ward.

There's more to this weird cycle of on and off and then I try to commit suicide again and was hospitalized again.

I am still hurt, can't trust anybody now and am not sure if I will ever get over this and be healthy again. My urges have subsided but they come back at random times. And I always just think how it was all my fault and I am a very selfish person. 

Sorry for the super long post.

Its difficult for me to contemplate but I feel suicide is a necessarily thing for me to do.

66733,"I'm an even bigger mess than I thought I wasI'm 23.

I've spent all of my years waddling through life, always with the ""What can I do for the world?"" thought process in the back of my head. I never succeeded. I never made huge achievements that would put me on the front page of the news. I never did anything that wow'ed my family. Most of my uncles earned a police record rather than a diploma, yet they're all hard workers who are well-deserving of good things...I, on the other hand, am not worthy of sharing even the same name with them. I'm no Man.My mom was a teenage mother, lost &amp; alone w/ nobody to support her. My father an often-ignored son of his father. They're both strong people today, who keep smiles on their faces despite being diabetic, financially-struggling, &amp; knowing that we're, in some ways, barely surviving.I was bullied all throughout my childhood. I learned what hatred was at an early age. I, for some reason, contemplated things like murder at such an early age as well...I guess I really hated being bullied.

And yet, I'm the only one out of my siblings to graduate. I'm the only one who actually had a shot at helping our family. But I blew it. I had a chance at a good university out of high school -- I turned it down. I had a good job offer -- I gave up halfway through because it meant me being away from family. I've now realized that maybe there's a reason why nothing ever works out for me. Maybe there's a reason why I'm never happy. Maybe....I'm meant to end it all myself.  
And now, as of today, I'm possibly jobless. I've been a no-call, no-show at work all week. Now I'm nervous if I should even bother stopping by &amp; asking if I even have a job anymore...I haven't answered my phone all week. I've shunned my family away. I thought for sure that this week was going to be it. I was going to find something -- anything -- to just end it all. And yet, last night, I wussed out again. I don't know why I can't go through with it,...but I want to.

In conclusion: I'm a fake. I'm a failure. I'm pathetic. I had the opportunities -- I blew them. I had the chances -- I didn't take them. I wander this subreddit &amp; help others -- I can't provide it to myself. I enjoy loving others -- I can't love myself. I preach patience -- I have none with myself. I preach kindness -- I've become angry with the world. 

I don't deserve anything that I have. I'm no help to anyone. I'm no service to anyone, &amp; never will be. I'm useless to the world &amp; myself. 

I'm sorry.

five plus three equals eight plus one

but we all know that in 

a few short years

he'll be six feet tall and broke to the ears

Or maybe it's Philosophy

Aristotle I dunno 

Growing certain plants in the backyard 

Oh, Here we go 

Again with the dreams

and short with the plans

I hear Bill got busted cause they found the three plants.

melting down from a blizzard that'll pass by and we know

Oh here we go with the dreams of snow

Vanish when you touch 'em and look a little less once you know

&amp;#x200B;

Well a man came to town 

and was boasting about how he'll be 

a big man, rich man, richer than you'll ever be

But yesterday I saw him

shining shoes at a mall

That's still a thing anymore?

Aparrently so

he's no rich I guess no one dares to say no.

And I understand this song might be a tad bit juvinile

What do you expect, it's probably being sung by a child

but I think you get the messege that I'm trying to convey here:

Get rich schemes tend not to end with fame here.

And so I'll repeat what I just said sans verse form 

Cause this verse in question is getting a little bit too long

So,

52515,"Im 19 and my life has already slipped through my fingersThis post is long, and I might be actually crazy, so consider yourself warned. This is everything from the past year that has made me feel like I can no longer go on:

1. I flunk out of my first semester of college with a 0.0. Instead of going on academic probation and allowing the possibility of making up those 0s, I transfer to my local community college. 

2. I go long distance with the guy Im dating (who I met in that first semester). After months of going to him every few weeks and telling him Im feeling neglected and that hes not pulling his weight in the relationship, I do the unthinkable. I've never cheated before in my life. Never had the urge to cheat. I know you probably all think Im a pos, and you're right. I know what I did was horrific and fucked up, and looking back I can see what a fucking moron I was. I cry almost every day over losing him. He wanted to stay friends after we broke up, and we were for a while, but recently we barely talk and I can finally feel that I've lost him for good. We had discussed getting back together in the future, and even though he initially flat out refused, he was drunk one night and told me how much he'd love to get back together, if only I hadn't cheated. After some back and forth he told me it was a possibility in the future, but I have a feeling he was just drunk and lonely. I held on to those words for months, and now I realize how foolish it was. Of course he doesn't want anything to do with me. He ended up taking this semester off and I blame myself. I did him so wrong when all I ever wanted was to be by his side.

3. When I transferred to community college from my private 4-year university, my financial aid did not. My parents are dirt poor, and I dont have a car and thus also dont have a job. Because the community college is a state school, they require additional income verification from me and my parents in order to approve my aid package. I mention this to my parents almost weekly for 4 months. They finally fill out the request form to obtain the documents I needed 2 weeks before the final cutoff to hand them in. The process takes up to 10 days, and between that and shipping times, the documents finally come in 2 days before the cutoff. 
   And my father had filled out the form incorrectly.
   I was unable to receive aid, and am now on the hook for $2,600. Again, no money from my parents, no job, no way to pay this back. I had to take the semester off because I couldnt enroll with an outstanding balance. The bill goes to collections Oct 16, but I can't get approved for a loan because Im 19 and have 0 income. Some guy I met offered to pay the bill and I really thought I had found an out and was outstandingly hopeful, but it turned out he was just a scummy pos who wanted to take advantage of my vulnerable state. Needless to say I blocked him and he is no longer in my life. 




So here I am, alone, trapped in my house with nowhere to go, no way to pay the money I owe, and no way to go back to school. I wanted to major in art. Im a painter. I've always loved art, and losing the opportunity to go to school is devastating. I have no motivation, no life plan, and no way to get out of this situation. And the worst part is, I understand that in the scheme of things, $2,600 is not a lot of money. My parents brag about how when I was a kid they spent more on weed than they did on rent, so ~$1k/month. They never put even a cent away for me to go to college, move out, etc. 

My situation is driving me crazy. Because I dont have a car, I can't leave the house to go anywhere (I live in very rural town, so really ~10 miles from town). Im going stir crazy, I see and hear people that arent there, and sometimes Ill just start arguing and screaming at someone who I know isnt there (ie turning and screaming at my mothers chair about how much i resent her when i know shes at work). I only do this when they're not home and I think Im really, REALLY sick. Im at the least borderline psychotic, but its fairly likely I have some form of bipolar, as I go through cyclic periods of deep depression and these psychotic scream at nothing moments where I feel very disconnected and detached from reality.   

I know all my problems I've caused myself. I've put myself in this position because Im terrible at prioritizing, staying motivated, and staying sober. It doesn't change the fact that Im looking into buying a gun. I can't do this anymore. If I can't get back to school, I dont have anything left to live for.",suicide
50216,"I just want to end everything. I think I had enough suffering for 6 years. I don't what to do with my lifeAll my life i have been mistreated by others. I have always been called ugly, laughed at it, given dirty looks and outcast. I really cannot take this pain anymore. I am now a 21 year old woman so any hope of me looking better is out the window. I dropped out of college because of depression and anxiety. It was really was an awful experience, had some people tried to give me a tough time because they didnt like me and thought i was ugly. I have been depressed for at least 6 years, it started because of bullying and now i feel disgusted and ashamed to show my face to anyone because of being put down so much. After i dropped out, i have been staying home for two years, barely going outside. I feel so terrible and guilty for doing nothing and my mom seeing this me way. Every time i go outside i feel so scared and i am scared people will insult me again. My mother is begging me to go back to college and to at least to do a little bit of it.

I feel so terrible but there is no way i am going to well in college feeling so miserable and anxious because of my apperance. i mean i wear sunglasses everywhere i go and try to hide my face as much as possible, so i wont get disgusted stares or comments. I also messed up a chance to get a job for the same reason. The thought of me walking in the halls, presentations, group work, the possiblity of being teased and called ugly again all over again is so terrifying and feels my heart with a sharp pain. I also have a problem concentrating in a classroom, i cannot focus on a lesson properly around people, i always seem to have them in side view vision and they notice it and get uncomfortable. I much would rather do online schooling but my mom is against that, so now i am just panicking.

I have been to therapy and to a psychatrist and none of that has helped me. I am thinking of trying again, but then thinking whats the point since it probably wont help. I dont see any point into anything. I dont know anymore i just want to kill myself and end this torture already.

66819,"I started having suicidal thoughts after a friend got plastic surgeryI met friend that I only knew for a short period of time, maybe a few months, and only met on the internet, got plastic surgery to his face. Even though it shouldn't bother me that much. It does. Since it happened I've been emotionally spiraling.

He had low self esteem. Even though I was attracted to him &amp; tried to talk him out of it, he was set on it. I really thought I had deep feelings for him. I thought about him all the time. Constantly. I would actually try to think of things to do to try to distract myself from the internet so I didnt seem like some kind of weird stalker. It was fucking hard to figure out things to do besides think about him. I was intrigued by him. I really badly wanted to get close to him. I never knew how without seeming too weird or too direct. Im stupid.

When I first saw a pic of him there were voices in my mind telling me things. Showing them to me. Lol. Im crying. As we got closer and closer emotionally within a short time he told me about his voices. I was so happy. When he told me that. Im so fucking stupid. I hate myself. Fucking end it. Lol. I was happy because i thought it was some kind of sign. Holy shit im crying lol. God im a fag. I thought it was a sign that we were supposed to meet and be together. 

His voices. I was afraid one was responsible for the way he felt and how he thought he was ugly. I wanted to murder that voice so he could see what i saw. So he could see himself as beautiful like i did. But i couldnt figure out how. We eventually stopped talking. I just wanted him to see how fucking beautiful he was.

Right before the surgery he contacted me and i told him that i loved him. I decided it didnt matter what he looked like.

I was wrong. Im so fucking stupid. It did matter. But at the time I really thought it didnt. I really thought i would like him and continue to want to talk to him after.

I didnt. 

After he got it i thought he was ugly. 

The thing is i never think people are ugly. I thought it was some kind of super power that i had. That i saw beauty in every single thing. I really thought that was some kind of xmen style ability that i had. I reallt thought that i could see into peoples souls and thats how i really knew if they are beautiful or not. Idk why i thought that. I guess because i always thought so many things in this world were beautiful &amp; fasinating to look at. 

But then this happened. 

I really thought i had an ability to see beauty deeply. On top of all that i really thought i loved him. For the stuff he said. What we shared in common was enough for me. I thought he was very intelligent and a good listener. We liked the same anime. Same sense of dark goofy stupid humor. Morbid fasinations with the internet &amp; memes. But deeper than that too. I thought.

One of our conversations we were talking about an entity (voice). I thought we shared it in common... Contacted the same being. I call him 3, my friend called him the Narrator. He was one time saying how fustrating it is the it doesnt really talk (useing human words) and i told him a technique to get closer to it. He told me he had already tried that from what he read in a eckhart tolle book. When he told me he already tried it.... I was so much more convinced about all these insane ideas ive been having. That the entities (voices) are in the invisible world and people can share them in common. I know it sounds like ima  mentally ill child... If you are someone who is still reading this: god bless you goddamn. I never read the book he got the technique from either. But knew about the author as a mystic &amp; shamen.

When he told me that i was so convinced we were meant to be friends. We were meant to speak and be close. Fuck, idk, i wanted it to be true. 

When he told me he made deeper contact with 3 i was overwelmed with joy. I thought him and i could get closer using 3's mind. I still sort of think that because im insane... But you see 3 is a good being and very helpful and kind. Not like the other voice that i thought was making him believe he was ugly. 

After he told me he had tried that eckhart tolle thing, and how he made deeper contact, he seemed irritated. Even though i was happy. And he was asking what more than. If 3 doesnt use human words what can you do with him? I was really confused by this. I was telling him about there being no need to use words the same way we do when you exist in a way where time &amp; death dont touch you. Because you dont have a relative understanding of the world the same way. 3 is here to teach us this so we can make deeper contact with the others. I often visualize 3 as a gate or doorway. Because he leads into the invisible world. The name 3 its self is reference to the holy trinity and the drama triangle. People often think of things in black &amp; white. Good &amp; evil. 3 is total neutrality and therefore 3 is the ability to see anything clearly. The 3ed eye. 

He seemed really confused by all this. I felt so stupid but i also felt this intense need to get closer to him because i wanted him. 

Idk. Even just talking about this now i feel weird. I feel like im slowly going into a trance or hallucinatory state... Maybe this is supposed to be happening.

I really thought i was in love with him.

Well, right before he got the surgery when he contacted me i told him i loved him because i thought i did. Kill me. Just fucking end it. 

Then when i saw him on cam a little while after the recovery... Thats when i realised how shallow &amp; superficial i am. I realised i lost my ability to see beauty. The conversation was so awkward. He was on cam and i was just talking. But i think he could tell something was wrong because i was choking like an idiot. I was panicked extremely. And i felt phsycially ill. While i was looking at him. I think he could sense it and i felt terrified. 

Since then i felt extremely ashamed and guilty. I had to face the fact that i only liked him for his looks and all those other things about us that i thought were good were fake... And come to terms about the shit wifh the voices being dellusional.. He took meds for them. I refuse to....

I was playing it up in my mind because i wanted us to fit together because i liked how he looked. Im superficial..  Right?

This was maybe 10 months ago. Ive had on and off suicidal thoughts. Sometimes i feel okay.

Sometimes when i feel bad im desperately trying to convince myself im  not insane i will draw him. Sort of. Things inspired by him at least. Once i put on a song that reminded me of us and i painted this mural on the wall of my garage inspired by him. It wanted it to be an xray image of part of his face. I took a picture of it and put it on tumblr and it got reblogs. Honestly that made me want to live because it surprised me that anyone would think anything i do is worth anything. Im shit. Im complete shit.

Saddest most pathetic part is that hes my tulpa. Lol. Hes my pretend imaginary bf in my head. Hes more my best friend now that me &amp; the real him dont talk than ever before. Thats pathetic and disgraceful.

He says all the right things though and hes back to being beautiful. In my mind. At least.

I live in my mind. Fuck the real world. Im just going to do so many shrooms i cant notice whats going on outside myself. 

I was talking to a hot guy on tinder &amp; im just gonna go bother him and beg him to buy me shrooms and edibles today then beat the living shit out of me. If im really lucky and play my cards right ill get gang raped or something too. That would be fun. 

I like myself more when i think about morbid things. Im done with eveyone around me feeling comfortable. 

Its game on destroying society. Theres no other reason to live before i kill myself than make everyone on earth as uncomfortable as i am. I hope everyone sees Ugly like i have.

I wish everyone could suffer the same way i have. I want them to see it so bad. I hate myself for loving beauty.",suicide

62069,"How should I do itI guess my depression started back after my dad had committed suicide when I was 9 with a gunshot to the torso \(not sure where\). I was constantly moving around from home to home with my mom ever since my parents divorced at 3. She was always moving me and my sisters, getting a new guy, letting them treat me however they wanted as well did she to me. I've got severe anxiety and depression and currently at 19 I've tried to off myself multiple times. Almost a week ago my husband and I got into a really bad argument where he head butted me multiple times and then smashed my dead dogs urn \(Had to put him down back in March\). After another hour or so of screaming and yelling I grabbed the baggie of adderall I had and downed the pills right in front of him and his little brother. Some of the pills hit my taste buds so I had a foul taste in my mouth, making me gag and puke up a small amount of the pills. I still at this point had a lot of mg of adderall in my body enough to at least induce something, which it did. Him and his brother left me home not even an hour later so they could go to the beach, leaving me lying on the bed in the basement, shaking with cold sweats, rising temperature, heart pounding, passing out every time I would sit up or stand. During the argument he had smashed my phone, so I had no contact with anyone as I was laying there feeling the most panic I've felt in my life. Nobody called the hospital. 2 nights ago I started seeing a man around the corner staring at me. I was in a panic constantly looking at him. I kept hearing voices upstairs and it sounded like someone smashed a window. Nobody was upstairs no window had been smashed. I kept waking my husband up by accident with my terrified gasps every time I would see one of the shadow people my brain was having me see. Yesterday I had an overcoming of rage and started to cut my wrist \(which I've never done before\) and started telling myself I deserve every single cut I give myself and every bruise he gives me. After about 20 minutes of this I go downstairs and began breaking things; when he came downstairs he questioned why I was doing what I was doing which in turn made me angry as I screamed at him and went after him towards the throat. Once I got hold he barely had the strength to get my hand off of him and pin me to the bed. He kept holding me down trying to calm me down which in turn just made me angrier and angrier until I managed to get him of, grab a screwdriver, and try to stab him. After an hour or so of this he finally called an ambulance, they took me to the hospital and asked me the normal suicide questions \(he told them about how I tried to kill myself with the pills\). I just kept telling them no to every question. They asked me where the cuts came from I told them they just appeared. They asked me about the pills I denied it. I think they knew I should have been admitted but they asked my husband and his brother if they think I'm still a danger and they said no. Every day since the incident I've just constantly wished it would have worked, constantly researching how to do it. I'm stuck on 3 ways, gun shot, hanging, and carbon monoxide but I'm not entirely sure which way would be the best. Please don't comment with ""get help"" ""don't do it"" and blah blah blah all that stupid crap. I just want to know which way would be the most efficient and will actually get the job done.",suicide

So I'm from UK and I'm at my last year in high school. There's this girl I've taken a liking to since we returned in September but we couldn't be more different. She's apart of the 'cool' guys and I'm more of those people who aren't the weirdos but not the cool people. I'm kinda in the middle. I've been in her science class for 3 years but I've only started to notice her properly now as I've had my eyes on another gal for ages but I don't like her anymore. I can't really talk to girls and I freeze up and just mumble stuff and walk away when I talk to them so it's not good, plus, I'm fat as hell but about 6ft so it's not as noticeable and I'm ugly so I'm not really the guy who'd catch your eye. Her on the other hand, is a small girl but she's gotta be the most beautiful girl I've seen and she actually talks to me a little bit and laughs at my jokes, she does it with other guys but it means a lot to me lol, ik it's weird. I also see her when walking home as she goes up the same hill a little with her little bro but I'm with friends and basically the whole school comes too. I don't want to try and talk to her or anything in front of people since that would just be embarrassing for her and me.

I'm looking for something I could ask, for example, I was thinking about saying like, ""hey, we got science homework tomorrow"" but then I thought about it and me just straight up asking her about homework then leaving is just creepy. I need something that will make her remember it and enjoy it while not being too long or like strange.

I like this girl a lot and I've told myself to just wait it out until I see if she gives me signs or anything that she likes me but I think she might since she hasn't talked to me for the last 3 years but now she like talked to me while I was waiting in the corridor and although she just asked me why I was standing away from the class, I just was like idk then got awkward and started mumbling stuff. Surely that means she wants to atleast talk, idk, she does it to alot of people but not people like me I'm pretty sure.

I have had depression for a very long time and I just started seeing someone. I am trying to get help and improve. Today I was even able to sit down and get some work done which was a huge deal to me, because I have been extremely low this week with a huge breakdown yesterday and a few really shitty things just happened. Then today I found out that I have to resign from an organization because of poor grades, and honestly this organization has been the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning and the only thing I find myself looking forward to. The board that had to do it was very kind, they didn't want to but they have to follow the rules. They were all crying too and they wished there was something they could do.
I cried so hard I made myself physically sick, something I haven't done since I found out my mom had a brain tumor. She's fine now by the way, and part of the reason I know I can't/won't hurt myself.
Even at my lowest, and I have hit some pretty bad lows, I wasn't really thinking about suicide. I am a really logical person, and even when I had those thoughts in passing I was always able to make them go away and reason myself out of it so I would stop thinking about it. I certainly never said it out loud. But today when I was crying in the bathroom, I said to outloud for the first time ""I want to die.""
I know for a fact I will not act on this feeling. I cannot do that to the people who love me (I am so god damn lucky to have them), and logically I understand the world isn't a better place without me, me dying will do more harm than good and all those other sort of platitudes that people tell those who are suicidal. I just... can't stop thinking it. It's a constant refrain in my head playing over and over and over.
I am so scared because these thoughts keep coming into my head and I have no control over it I can't stop them and I can't act on them what can I do?

I throw up my thoughts onto the page

Herbal sedation of hibiscus and sage

And no one will hear my silent cries

My painful protests against the growing lies

Its all so loud

I do not dare

The watching eyes

That always stare

Im just a kid

I swear im learning

Please just stop

My world is turning

White flashes

Deepened gashes

Stop the flow

But still nobody knows..

Black..

My fist is bleeding

The silver vase on the vanity

We was a little bigger so he had no problem messing with me. I‚Äôd lend him a pencil, then ask for it back and he‚Äôs break it. He‚Äôd kick me sometimes. He‚Äôd thrown my backpack across the hallway before. Then he gets an essay I was working on, as we were walking out of school, by grabbing it out of my backpack and rips it to shreds. I got so fucking pissed because I actually spent to much time on it. I ended up clocking him somehow, I think it was a right hook after I ducked under one of his weird ass swings.

We both go to the office and he has a bloody nose and is calling me names and shit. My dad shows up before his and then yells at me for 10 minutes telling me about how i‚Äôm grounded when I get home and that my life is over. The teachers and the kid got a kick out of it.

I then get in his car and he laughs and says he‚Äôs glad I won or else i‚Äôd be walking home lmao. He bought me a milkshake. He taught me how to box too so that‚Äôs one of the reasons I think I was able to win.",non-suicide
51966,"You Die in Your Own ArmsFor the past 8 years, I have been struggling to overcome severe clinical anxiety and depression. It has been quite a long journey, and I have learned a lot about myself and the world along the way. Every single day of my life, I wake up and go about my basic responsibilities all while wearing a mask to hide my internal suffering from the outside world. Most of my friends and colleagues know that I am not exactly a happy person, but nobody other than myself knows the extent to which this depression has reduced me to nothing more than a shell of my former self.

I have been having intrusive and vivid thoughts of suicide for many years. For most of my life, I always assumed I would eventually kill myself once things got bad enough. I've used that logic to motivate me and get me to the point that I'm at now, but I believe the time is quickly approaching to actually follow through.

For my entire life, I have had to deal with the symptoms of severe social anxiety. This disorder has made my life practically unbearable. All of those opportunities wasted, all of those relationships destroyed, and all of those times I've made a failure out of myself....all because of a neurological disorder that is beyond my control. I can't blame the disorder for my shortcomings, but at the very least I can blame it for reducing my quality of life to practically nothing. My anxiety has caused me to develop a co-morbid and chronic depression. These two psychological afflictions have pushed me to my breaking point and stripped my life of any hope and joy.

I have spent the majority of my life secluding myself from others, only forming relationships for my own personal benefit. I have been in love twice, and both relationships ended as a result of my selfishness and neuroticism. The only times in my life where I've ever felt an inkling of happiness was during those relationships. All I ever wanted was to feel like I had a real reason to live. Something bigger than myself to stay alive for. Those precious moments with a significant other, hearing them tell you that they love you, can change your life.

For a while, I believed that within this love, I would finally find the happiness I was looking for. However, I was mistaken. If there's one lesson I've learned in my life, it's that you die in your own arms. In the end, everyone will turn their back on you when it suits them best. The idea of love is so phony and fake it makes me sick. Love will eventually turn cold, and you'll be left all alone with your problems and emotions. Eventually, you'll be right back where you started. Only this time, you will be haunted by the memories of the past.

So here I sit, typing this wall of text for no real reason. I've reached the point in my life where I cannot possibly see any reason to keep going. Every day is suffering, every good thing in life turns to shit, and in the end you're left to die in your own arms with your own problems that you created.",suicide
47476,"Second attemptSorry for the long text.

Incurable cancer. I refused treatment because fuck dying more slowly. I don't have many friends (learned a long time ago that people suck) and refuse to bring them into my shitty life. Even though I told them I made my peace with it, I lied. 

As im typing this, I'm crying. I wish I could have had a full life like most people, but somehow I got the short straw. 

I lost my apartment because the tenants where I was supposed to move refused to leave due to covid, and govt is so overwhelmed with such requests they can't help in a timely fashion. Also I'm living in a shitty motel which is way beyond my means (I can no longer work) and getting kicked out in 12 hours because I can't pay. Fuck that, I'm not becoming homeless.

So right now I'm using my last (sold everything I owned to make it at the shitty motel) 10 dollars to get drunk off my ass on 2 litres of 10% beer, then hopefully not wake up from a sleeping pill overdose. 

I wish there were people I could talk to that can relate and not try to stop me. Hot lines are shit and completely unhelpful. Support groups only try to stop me.

The worst thing is being completely alone and feeling like you've abused everyone's good will just to stay alive longer... For what purpose. 

But the worst thing imaginable is leaving my poor little ferret alone, weeks after he lost his life partner to illness. I wish I had faith in my close ones to help him find a new, proper home but I lost faith in everything. I love you, faithful Nibbler. And I'm sorry to leave you like that. I can only hope that friends and family take good care of you. So long, friend.

48029,"Just a couple questions, any help is appreciatedOkay so I'm not like about to do it tonight or anything, so don't worry about me like dying right away. I'm not quite sure to put this onto a medical forum or mechanic forum, but this is probably the only one that wouldn't be weirded out so I'll shoot.

&amp;#x200B;

My current suicide fantasy is driving out to a secluded place into the woods with a silicone tube and killing myself via carbon monoxide. I like this method as it leaves the body untouched, ergo not as traumatic for whoever trucks my body away, along with minimizing pain for family members. I also like it, as while it seems to have a high likelihood of being successful (unlike a method like sleeping pills), it seems to have relatively small consequences if something goes wrong, unlike hanging or gunshot suicides. The largest problem arises with catalytic converters removing almost all the carbon monoxide, but I have a plan to circumvent that. I plan on unbolting the exhaust system right before the catalytic converter and inhaling those gases instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my main two questions are A: would breathing in exhaust directly from the engine of a modern car be similar to tailpipe exhaust pre-1973, and B: what are the health risks of a failed suicide attempt via carbon monoxide poisoning, are there any life-changing permanent disabilities?

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and I guess if we're throwing in questions what does it mean for like my mental state if I think about this on a fairly regular basis, like maybe 10 times a day or so. I use this typically as a method of escapism, like I get an overwhelming feeling of being a failure or social reject, I'll think about this until I get distracted with something else.

50781,"if society sucks and im just going to be a loser forever why not just kill myself?what good does it really do me to keep trying. I know its for nothing and even though I tried fairly hard it was too little, too late, and my problems have grown beyond me being able to handle them.

Im pretty isolated. the my family has a lot of problems, and anger towards each other and me because its a pretty hopeless situation.

Even if I find a way to be less of a burden, it still wont matter because things are bad, people are in rough health and the situation is still fucked regardless.

and as far as me, im doomed. I dont think it matters how hard I try, even if I try to open up a direction for myself its too late and Ive already fucked past whatever real opportunities I once had.

I have a couple degrees but its not gonna get me any good work out of the gates anywhere and doesnt really qualify me for anything even though I know a lot. I could go on further if it was really a possibility, but because of how Ive done it id have to pay to take a lot of individual classes over a year or two before I could even apply to go on.

im pretty much well fucked. I could go get certified to do some petty nothing job and I probably will. but it wont be much/any better than minimum wage and I'll probably still be locked into it for life.

Im already more alone and bitter than anyone. I even hate society and everyone else because I feel trapped with negative people in a hopeless situation.

I doubt I'll ever be in a position to date or be around anyone ever again. I dont even try. I dont even have anyone to really relate to. Im a mess and I dont expect any of that, but its really a depressing state.

my motivation to continue is dwindling as my chances of any true escape dwindle. Is it even worth trying to settle for less? Are things actually somehow going to get better someday if I only dont give up now?

58255,"My story of depression and anxiety - suicide attemptsI am not entirely sure where to post this except here. Here is my story I am 26 years old. I was with someone for 3 years and was planning to propose on our 3rd year anniversary, unfortunately he broke up me before our anniversary date. The aftermath was complete shit, I made every possibly mistake in the book, on what not to do to get an ex back. After 1 month of the BU I made my first suicidal attempt. 4 to 5 months later, which is 3-4 weeks ago (timeline is pretty much a blur for me) I made a second attempt on my life which led me to be hospitalized for several hours under suicide watch. Officially today, I started taking anti-depressants. I do not regret trying to take my own life because I created such a horrible car wreck between my ex and myself that I no longer want to live with that guilt. Regardless if my intentions were good or not. I still made some bad choices, but I don't think my suicide attempt was one of them. Few days till now, I was planning to do another suicide attempt. I have two plans in mind, but I haven't done anything to put it into action. I'm just only thinking about it. Each day becomes harder than the next. My ex's last words would forever resonate within me. I visited my ex home unannounced about 4 times. I would send him text that I am coming. Then show up in front of his doorstep. During those 4 times he would accept me into his home and we would talk. Most of the time, we ended up having sex. Which made things incredibly worse for me. After my second attempt in suicide. I tried going over to his house again, he said he will call the police. Over the past 3 weeks, I would hear him and his friends youtube/twitch stream talk about me. Not very positively. I can avoid watching or hearing whatever him and his friends are saying. The point is I left such a negative mark on someone I cared about the most. I feel guilty, ashamed, not worthy of much. His friends tell me, he just wants to move on, us go our separate ways, but one thing that will always carry me is his last words to me. I will never be able to forget that. That is what is still pushing me to think of suicide. That feeling of being seen as a bad guy. Being seen as a crazy ex gf. Hurts me incredibly. My ex isn't a bad person. However, speaking to his friends about my side of the story makes me feel like I am. I am no longer speaking to his friends. However, my ex's words and his friends words are still in my heart and in my mind. I still want to end my life. Ending my life means no more responsibilities, no more anxiety, no more overthinking, no more heartache, and I no longer have to carry this horrible memory of what I have done to push my ex so far. I just want the pain to end. I just want to forget. I want unhear what he said about me, I want to be left alone. I deserve happiness, yet it has not arrived to my doorstep. I just want everything to standstill for just a moment so I can scream and cry. Have no one judge me for crying and feeling the way I feel. I feel so utterly lost, hurt and misunderstood. My whole being right then and there died with me on my first attempt. I no longer remember who I was before. Please help, I am seeing a psychiatrist and therapist. I began taking my anti-meds today. I just feel so lost and hurt. I feel ashamed of my actions after the break up. If I didn't push my ex so hard and seemed so desperate, I probably would be talking to him today.   ",suicide
62435,"A Numerical Model for MoodI would like to explain how I view my mood and life as a whole.  I tend to think of matters mathematically.  Imagine a scale from -10 to 10, with -10 being the worst I could possibly be feeling, 0 being neither happy nor sad, and 10 being the best I could possibly be feeling.  Now, I'm not going to lie and say that I'm always at a -10 because that's simply not true.  However, I am almost always somewhere in the negative range.  Sure, there are those rare occasions in which I may jump up into the positive range temporarily, but the average value is deep in the negatives.  I have not just been feeling this way recently.  What I am currently describing defines how I have been feeling for as long as I can remember.  Now to suicide.  Suicide would remove me from the scale entirely, as I would be unable to experience neither positive nor negative emotion.  Because this can't really be quantified, let's call it the closest thing: 0.  I think we can all agree that a negative value is less than 0.  So committing suicide would increase the value of the way I feel according to this scale.

I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts since I was 10 years old and things have been exceptionally bad lately. I have no friends. I have no hobbies. I don't talk to anybody. I can't trust people. I used to want to do medical research and make the world better for people. Now, I have so little faith in humanity and so little passion or drive that I don't know what the hell I've been working towards and I just want to give up.

Yesterday was my 21st birthday. Growing up I never thought I'd make it past 16. I have no idea why the hell I'm still around. Part of me wants to try and go to therapy, but I know it's hopeless. I've just been delaying the inevitable for years. If I had killed myself when I was still a teenager I would've avoided so much loss and heartache. I'm so hurt and tired all the time and I want it to stop. I live alone so it'd be so easy to just take a kitchen knife and get it over with. The only reason I haven't is the fear of being sent back to a mental hospital if I fail.

I'd like to drown in alcohol and giggle hysterically. I'd like to smoke a pack of cigarettes to burn my lungs and hope they give up on me. My mind is filled with thoughts and chaotic images of blood then it just stops thinking. I'd like to go now, please. I've thought of ways on how to do it and they are all I think about when I am not numbingly sitting in front of the TV watching the images flicker on screen. Surely, i'll miss my family. I hope they'll miss me, too. I haven't been very nice to them; been too harsh, too unforgiving. I'll miss my dog, mostly. My dog is old. Maybe I'll wait for her so I can follow.

I wish that I could just be locked away alone forever to cry alone, away from human complexities.

I've been able to realize how cruel people can be, how easily impressionable they can be and how disloyal they can be.

Maybe I'm too detached from society and reality to even understand why people are like this.

And, after I come home from a hellish day at school, I go home and I'm tormented by my siblings because of my weakness as the second youngest child. They always enforce their physical strength over me, I'm afraid to step out of line because they could hit me, and I could do nothing back \(this doesn't happen often, I am just threatened usually\).

You know how anytime someone kills themselves people come out and say oh why didn't they ""reach out""? I have reached out multiple times to my GP doctor, to charities, to local mental health support groups. Nothing stops the anxiety. I do mindfullness, I do therapy, I do breathing excercises, I do hobbies in the two hours I have when I get home from work and and on the weekend, I've taken four different SSRIs.

I dont drink much (maybe 2 or 3 glasses of wine a month) but my liver is failing. 

I was supposed to get more blood work done to figure out the cause (probably autoimmune) but between C19 shutting everything down, I cant get anything done. 

 My blood work is always all over the place anyway.

I've been anemic for about 2 weeks, my stomach is severely distended from ascites, i have awful bruising all over my body, my SOB is getting worse and just getting up to feed the dogs feels like I ran a marathon. I'd be surprised if I dont show signs of jaundice by next week. 

I'm a mid level practitioner, so I know this will be a painful road ahead. I'm just done.

I'm beyond furious that the hospital I work at has restarted non essential surgeries. Between capitalism and dipshit people walking around, I hope it ends the way we all hope it's going to end.

I'm in relatively good shape otherwise. I'm a very healthy  weight (low side of normal), I eat pretty good, I floss everyday, I go to work, etc.

Honestly, I'd rather not get the blood work and skip whatever treatment they'd like to put me on. It would be slow death but I could cash out a part of my life insurance to live it up for a month or two.

49530,"Not suicidal, but lost best friend to suicide. Need help coping.I lost my best friend of six years to suicide about 3 days ago. It was very sudden and unexpected, as he had made plans as far as two weeks from now. He bought concert tickets, arranged a sushi date, scheduled a doctor's appointment. I'm very confused and devastated.  

He had been there for me through all the rough times I've had. I also lost my dad to suicide and he stayed up with me on the nights when I couldn't sleep coz I was so grief stricken. We played World of Warcraft together and had conversations for hours. He was there when I lost my grandparents, my childhood dog. He helped me through the times when I myself had bouts of depression. All he asked in return was my friendship. 

He also had severe depression on top of multiple medical conditions, which caused him constant pain. I tried my best to be there for him, I always dropped what I was doing to be at his side when he was hurting, emotionally or physically. Now that he's gone, I feel like I didn't do enough. I loved him so much, and my love couldn't save him. 

I feel like part of me is gone. There is a huge void in my heart. I feel numb and empty. I keep expecting a call or a text. I keep checking my friends lists to see if he's online. I had a day of anger after he died. I blamed everyone I possibly could but that didn't help either. I'm also a bit mad at him for choosing this. 

I don't have a lot of friends, and he was the only friend who really knew me. Who I truly opened up to. I know I'll be okay some day, but what am I gonna do? Who will I talk to? What I am gonna do when I need my best friend? That's what scares me most of all. ",suicide

Option 1. Stay on the meds I'm on &amp; continue to hear people laughing and talking about me whenever I leave the house. Continue to be uncomfortable every time I'm outside. Continue to have crippling anxiety.

Option 2. Go back on Seroquel, a medication that heavily sedated me &amp; made me lose all motivation but it worked well for my symptoms.

Option 3. Go on clozapine. The last resort drug for treatment resistant schizophrenia. It comes with a tonne of side effects. Weekly blood tests and physical health risks.

56282,"Why shouldn't I? I have severe anxiety and depression, recently made worse by a series of very stressful events, including an emergency surgery and my house being hit by a tornado. I have suffered from anxiety/agoraphobia since I was 12. I am 36 now. 

Since I had the surgery in April, I have been unable to gain my strength back and have been on a downward spiral. I'm severely agoraphobic, to the point I barely leave my room. I am incredibly depressed. I have no energy to do the simplest things. 

I voluntarily committed myself to a mental hospital in early July after a few trips to the ER for the exhaustion and also a stroke-like episode. I couldn't move my arm for a minute or less. Nothing was found and it was attributed to anxiety and being sedentary. 

The hospital was horrible. They had no idea how to treat anxiety disorders. The nurses were rude and overworked. The doctor was a megalomaniac who talked right over me. Their treatment was to withhold food and medicine until I could get to the dining room or nurse's station, activities I had difficulty with due to my agoraphobia. I discharged myself from the hospital. 

I entered a different hospital on August 12th. I stayed 10 days. I was started on Nardil and given some new therapy for treating anxiety. It seemed to work although not as well as I had hoped. I thought I would be much better upon release. I am not. I was released Tuesday. 

I think I'm worse. Since coming home i actually feel more agoraphobic, exhausted, and unable to move about the house. I also have POTS, which is a heart rate/blood pressure issue. It seems to be keeping me from being able to tolerate any meds. Right now I feel awful on the Nardil. It is really my last hope. I have tried every class of medication and several combinations over the past 20 years. MAOIs were all I had left. Nardil seems to be exacerbating my POTS. I can't seem to move. I just want to die and not be a burden on my parents anymore. I have no one else. Years of this illness have taken everything from me. No career. Never finished my degree, although I was about to but I will likely have to drop this semester because I can barely sit at my desk. I can't concentrate. My parents are sick of me. I can't blame them. They should be enjoying their retirement rather than being my nurses. Friendships have all died. No lovers except one woman who chose someone else over me. She is in Europe right now with her lover while I wonder if I will be committed again. She claims to still love me. She just loves things and has someone who will give them to her. 

I feel awful, alone, hopeless and cannot find a reason to live. I've done everything to get better. I failed. I just want this nightmare to be over. There is nothing left. 

God, someone have an answer. I've committed myself to mental institutions TWICE! What the fuck more do I have to do? Give me a break, a hand, some hope. I don't know what to anymore. ",suicide

I also started thinking that I and my worthless and my parents just waste money on me and feel pettiness for them. I managed to overcome those thoughts by talking to my parents and them convincing me it's all right. It worked well. 

=Turning point incoming!


Then another day came last month . The worst one in my whole life and the one where I think I will try to destroy the much. It was a regular day after a break of one week. It was the first day and was so depressing for me. Then once in a class, some bully took my stuff and I tried to get it. Then someone came and held me and he hit me and gave me a scar. It is 1 mm above my eyebrow with an ugly shape. Since then I became so depressed. I been thinking that this scar will follow me all my life and haunt me. I feel like depression will be my close friend and that it didn't stop in my thoughts but also my skin. After a month of being humiliated and that bully bragging about it. I punched him. Even though I gave him no scar but swollen his eye. That moment I was happy. But after 2 days depression haunted me again and had the same thoughts again. Please help me anyone. I want to overcome the scar and the thoughts of it. I feel hopeless and my life will never be the same and I will look ugly. I feel like it will be a reminder for the school moments that I always tried to forget. Whenever I try to take a photo I feel like this scar will be there in front  of my head  haunting me.",suicide

We were too young to remember, or we think that one thing that happened doesn't count, or we are in denial that that's what it truly was. But our body remembers. Our bodies and our souls, they carry the heaviness of the pain that we can never seem to put down. I believe that most of the times people want to end their lives, even if they are doing it slowly through addictions or passive behaviors, it's for this reason. 

Whether we were manipulated, tricked, forced, brutalized, lied to, used and discarded... all of these actions cut deep, to the very core of our being, and it feels like there's no way to ever move past them. When there's nothing else to distract us, the weight is unbearable.",suicide

53701,"NoteI've been feeling especially depressed lately (including a resurgence of suicidal thoughts), and as an exercise I wrote up a suicide note. I don't like being depressed and I want to beat it. I almost posted this in /r/depression, but I figured they would just point me here anyway. What I really want to know is - What the hell is wrong with me? All my life I've always felt like people were giving me the run around or talking me up just to be nice. I really feel sort of trapped in a world of dishonest people who would rather spare feelings than tell the harsh truth... Anyway, here's my note. It comes off a little melodramatic, but I guess they all do when you haven't actually done anything.

&gt; If you are reading this ‚Äì I am dead. You may be asking ""why?"" and this note is intended to answer that question. For one, I have failed to achieve anything that I have ever set out to achieve, all of my accomplishments are hollow and void of any meaning (What good is a degree if you can't use it, and what good is simply graduating if you didn't try your hardest?) It makes me less than human ‚Äì the lowest of the pond scum ‚Äì to simply go on existing in this way. Women don't want me, they never have, and it would be foolish of me to expect them to do so later on in my life, especially given my financial prospects and my living situation. Employers don't want me, and they likely never will, as my skills and personality are not conducive to the 9-5 work for the man world many people choose to enslave themselves to. To my friends ‚Äì I don't want you to blame any of this on yourselves. Go on with your lives, have kids, make money, and most importantly be happy. I know I could be fun sometimes as sort of a novelty, but overall my existence was only a burden to those I cared about. It is a better thing for me to rid them of that burden than it is for me to selfishly continue to go on in a meaningless sub-human existence simply for my own purposes. As for disposing of what remains of me ‚Äì I do not want a funeral. I do not wish to have a memorial service. I do not even want people to gather in my name in any way. Simply go about your lives as if I had never existed, and give my corpse to science. I am a leech. Vermin. A horrible pox on the house of humanity, and I must be dealt with accordingly. Goodbye.

62437,"Looking for respect for my decisionHi, I‚Äôm trying really hard to rationalise this so please bare with here.

I have always struggled with confrontation and asserting my personality to others. I am by no means shy on the surface but I am very introverted naturally. When I first met my boyfriend, we were both in a similarly pessimistic position in our lives. A bit stuck but wanting to slog on and hopefully journey to relative happiness. We have propped each other up now for around 3 years, and actually (I think) in quite a healthy and supportive way. I love him so, so much. I truly believe that we have a unique connection that I couldn‚Äôt find with anyone else. I am a lot more deep in my understandings of the world than him. Although he loves me, he doesn‚Äôt believe in the idea of a one true love and he has never been with another woman. He believes himself, though not through medical diagnosis, to perhaps be on the autism spectrum and can struggle with emotionally driven trains of thought. I was attracted to him initially as he never conducted any of the bull relationship politics at the beginning of the relationship, and I always hated the men that I dated previously that did that. His treatment of me was so pure and so honest.

Recently, I have noticed that he is really trying to upheave his life and get rid of some of the bad habits he has. He came close tonight to ending it with me and I think some underlying feelings came out about not being sure that my characteristics are what he wants for his lifelong partner. Although he loves me, I understand that my approach to life must make things hard for him. But this is the problem. He loves me and will not leave me despite me stressing that I would always support him regardless. We have already faced some rough times in such a short relationship (3 years) such as family deaths, horrible job situations, I uprooted and moved 2 hours away from family to live with him, etc. I want him to soar but I am holding him back, and not by my own choice. He loves me too much to make that sacrifice for himself. I love him enough to do just that, and I know that if I isolate myself from him and continue to live then he will fight to get me back. Part of me thinks he just doesn‚Äôt want to be alone.

I also feel strongly about deciding when I die in general. I watched my father die from painful spinal cancer around 2 years ago. I do not want to experience the mental anguish that he did in his inability to decide his own fate. I want to come to terms with my own mortality at my own pace if I can help it.

I think now is around the time to start processing that, with a view to end my life this year. I did have the end of April as an end goal so that I could reach 24 and have one final birthday with everyone I love. I want to gradually say goodbye in my own way to everyone and be at peace with it. I want some meaningful conversations with little cousins to occur naturally so that I can instil a bit of the wisdom I did learn in my short life and function as a bit of hope when they know that I am gone. Life can be so cruel and experiences can chew you up and spit you out until you have nothing left in your own self to want to live for. I would never want anyone to hurt inside like I do but I must do the right thing.

I am definitely going to do this. There is no question about it so please don‚Äôt leave messages trying to convince me otherwise. What you all do is amazing, but I am here seeking respect for my decision. That would be the best help and support from this wonderful community that I could receive. I know a lot of you understand and that understanding is rare. I need that so I can contentedly go rather than angrily. I have a funeral fund set aside to cover costs, and have a letter of instruction written for my brother in law, who is a funeral director. I am not scared to die. And I hope that my loved ones will understand. I just wish that I could see into the future to know that my love will be cared for. I am certain that this will be the kick that he needs to become the person that he wants to be and that in years to come he will be happier for this. P, if you are reading this, know that I am grateful for all of your love and everything that you have done for me.

47890,"If we were to kill all men I am a man and I am proud to be a man. I know this movement is so fucking old but hear me out. IF women were to kill all men, not only would they be charged with hundreds of counts of murder, and be sent to jail for the rest of their lives (at least the ones that killed multiple men) but they would also die out and destroy our species. 

I've heard so many women say that they would be able to live in a world without men, they wouldn't. Humans, believe it or not, are not a self-reproducing species; women need some kind of way to get their eggs fertilized and that way is male sperm.

Now I know you may think that, ""oh, well then we'll just get a bunch of sperm from men and then kill them!"", but no. Because a) you are now doubling back on your point that you don't need men, when you do because they are the only member of our species that can create viable sperm. And b) what will you do when the sperm runs out? You won't be able to reproduce anymore, and you'll die out. Simple

it's been a hell of a week. after running away from home for several hours (literally on the run. i guess normally you would leave at a time when you wouldn't be noticed but i ran the hell away right in front of them) with the desire to kill myself, i came back home to find a bunch of police at my house. they took me to a psychiatric hospital about 2 hours away from home. the people there were nice but they all had different types of problems than i did (depressed and suicidal because of drug use/parents/bullying). also the treatment there didnt really help... how does isolating you from your situation help you deal with it? the groups lasted for like 10 mins and consisted of them asking the same questions and not even looking at us bc they were scribbling down our answers. i just started saying 'happy' every time they asked me my mood because in there i didn't really feel anything at all. 

i didnt really cry or connect with anyone until the very last day i was in there when people were talking about what lead to them being brought there and the guy in front of me was being prompted by the staff member: 'so why were you suspended?' 'because i messed around on the bus' 'then what, what brought you here?' 'and then i tried to kill myself' and then i just broke as everyone else talked. didn't help that beyonce's 'i was here' was playing.

64004,"Lost and looking for somethingTL:DR  
Childhood abuse paved way for messy future, stuck hopelessly floating the stormy sea of ""fml""

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years (Currently 25) I've been dealing with severe childhood trauma. To the point where I suppressed memories and felt like I was in a ghost shell. I couldn't really memorize things, math/science/schooling was difficult due to that. My family just assumed I was the dope out of my three siblings. I was never given much attention in regards to falling behind..I used to harm myself, and so far I've avoided those habits. Even old ways of venting seem useless. I even lost joy in being mean to myself.

After my grandfather passed away the summer before my 24th birthday.. Huge chunks of my childhood started flooding back. I still have nightmares about it. The more I remember the more crazy and messed up I feel.

I DO love myself, it's still hard for me to rationalize how and why this happened to me.

I feel like a burden to the few friends and family I can talk to about this..I know people say therapy helps, but I'm terrified of telling all of this to anyone. It's getting to the point where I feel  like I'm living a lie, because I don't feel like people even know who I am, or what I'm going through daily.

I've reached out to loved ones before, when I've been at my worst and thought I had schizophrenia-my family mostly treated me like I didn't know what I was talking about. Disregarded my request for help..Later my dad pulled me aside and said if I was serious, he'd help me..That was nice, but all in all, It was discouraging. 

I'm at a point where I've felt suicidal for the majority of my life, even before I learned what the word meant.. I'm tired. Exhausted. Life is losing luster. My relationship has been unhealthy with my boyfriend for a time now, I'm desperately trying to mend or repair the few things in my life that I CAN control. I know suicide is something a lot of people feel is selfish but, if my quality of life is this miserable why would someone blame me?

Am I supposed to endure suffering, continuously, so others around me don't feel inconvenienced by my death?

Idk man, it's a big cluster mess. I need help, I don't know who to turn to anymore or what else to do. Nothing seems to work. I don't want to keep going alone, but idk who out there is willing to seriously help me. If I keep getting moved aside or if people keep giving up on me.. I fear I'll give in. I want to love life, I want to feel the shine people say I bring them.. If I'm a lighthouse where's my warmth going? If not to me? 

Again, anything anyone thinks might be useful-would be great. Sorry for the mess of words. I don't know what to say really.",suicide
58838,"I shouldn't feel this wayBipolar guy here with past drug addictions. I shouldn't want to kill myself. I finally got a job and I am busy again. However, the job is long hours and I work later and therefore I get so tired. My thoughts are so stupid and lead me to want to end it all because what's the point? I stopped hanging out with people. I have trouble forming close friendships or relationships with women. Maybe I'm scared of getting hurt. I am comparing myself to other people thinking I don't make enough money. It takes me 90 minutes to get to work and I'll never move out of my parent's basement(26) to live closer because my salary isn't enough to live closer. It took me a long time to finish college and get a job because of all the hospitalizations I had as a result of manic episodes. I could go on and on. The point is I'm not happy with what I have. I read some posts here and it seems that many of you have had much worse history's but the feeling I get is the same regardless. The negative thinking never ends... I stopped telling anyone I have these feelings cause they don't understand. The meds don't seem to make a difference...

46934,"I'm a failure and a disappointment. When there's nothing left but guilt, why continue?I've always said that I would kill myself if life got too hard. I don't believe in god or an afterlife, so it always seemed like the right thing to do. My life philosophy has been to enjoy myself, and if that's no longer possible, what's the point?

I am everything I don't want to be. I'm a 24 year old college dropout virgin living in my mom's basement, working for my dad, buried in debt and getting high everyday. I got myself into credit card debt in my time in college, and because I'm capable of making long-term plans but incapable of following them in the short term, it's not gotten any better. I've spent the last two years with the *active goal* of getting out of credit card debt, and I'm exactly where I was when I started. I'd be worse off if I hadn't already hit my credit limit, I'm sure.

But this isn't about money. This is about guilt. I have let down everyone I know and love on so many occasions that they have lost faith in me. And rightly so. I'm flakey. If I promise to do something, I *might* do it. If only my conscience would let me live like that... I feel terrible every time I go back on my word, every time I so much as suspect that I've let someone down. The only thing that has kept me going till now was the constant deep feeling of guilt. Is that any way to live?

I have no self-motivation. I can't do *anything* unless someone's breathing down my neck about it. Left to my own devices, I get high, play video games, masturbate and sleep. Wake up, rinse, repeat. I let my lizard starve and dehydrate to the point that when I finally tried to give him water, he was so weak he drowned in it. I got a puppy with my previous roommate, and we neglected him until he took off one day and got hit by a car. And that was the better fate for him... Two weeks ago, I skipped an entire week of work. I haven't gone to work since Thanksgiving now. I'm an embarrassment to my dad; he wants me to do well, he tries to push me, but I don't respond. I haven't said a word to him since Sunday, not even to tell him I won't be coming in. Because then I'd feel worse, and I'm a coward. I have a sense of responsibility, but no willpower, so my commitments end in disappointment for all and guilt for myself.

Somewhere along the line, I failed to learn basic human social skills. I can't carry a conversation. I get scared and can't describe my ideas to anyone. I'm reading a book, you ask me about it. I give you a dismissive answer and go back to reading, not because I'm an asshole, but because you scare the shit out of me. I'm terrified of touching people; anything from an attention-getting poke to a hug. Hell, I can't even say people's *names* because it feels wrong. Because of all this, it takes a huge amount of effort for me to even be in social situations, let alone try to talk to people. I end up isolated by choice, and hating myself for it.

So that's what it comes down to. I'm a selfish, loathsome person, and I hate myself for it. I feel nothing but guilt and self-loathing, except when I'm escaping through drugs and entertainment. The only thing stopping me from killing myself now is figuring out the best method and who to leave notes for.


EDIT: I drove around today looking for a good place to jump from, but couldn't find one. I spent the rest of the day in a weed-fueled haze at a friend's house almost entirely quiet, drifting in and out of consciousness. Then, as I was coming home, I pulled into a cemetery and spent the next hour holding a knife to my throat and listing the reasons I had to die.

But obviously, I couldn't do it. I called my therapist to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Clearly my antidepressant is no longer cutting it. I'm going to talk to my mom about my attempt tomorrow morning, and my dad at work. I hope for the best with that.

I constantly work out and exercise and still no attention. 

People are severely unkind and I'm so ugly apparently that even when I have a mental breakdown, no one seems to notice or maybe they just don't care. People on here keep saying to cut out all toxic people from your life to be mentally sound. 

Of course that sounds logical and great but then I found myself all alone. Everyone seemed to be incredibly toxic: family members with their lack of knowledge on mental health issues, friends and co workers with their degrading comments and gossiping towards people who aren't like them (like seriously one guy complained because this woman eas taking off from work weeks at a time....for chemotherapy. Who bitches about that). It's all so toxic I constantly feel like I am still in high school despite being around people close or in their 30s.

I feel like my life has massively gone downhill and I can't get out of it, I'm crying as I write this. Please, please someone just listen to me.

 I can't even breathe, everyone I have ever loved has left me. My dad left my mum a week ago and he said he'd never talk to me again, even though I'm 18 and he was never much emotionally involved in my life it's just surfacing so many feelings of being unwanted and abandoned. I'm autistic and was severely bullied in school and called all sorts of names, insulted by my weight and physical appearance, social skills, meltdowns, etc. I never had one friend at school and I had several nicknames to make fun of me. I had so many people make fun of me that it made my self-esteem extremely low. I had parents who never understood how sensitive I was or that I'm autistic, I was only diagnosed when I was 14.

I've been wishing death upon myself since I was about 7, and I don't even care anymore, I've just been walking into traffic. I've been overdosing on diazepam for days just to try to get through my anxiety, I took 50mg yesterday and It's hard to not take more. It's just so much pain in my chest, physical pain. I cry so hard I feel like I can't even breathe. It sounds stupid but my cat was the only thing in my life since I was 5 years old that was my friend but he died two months ago and I miss him so much. I just can't believe he's gone. I had my only real relationship and friend that lasted 6 months ago end 3 months ago after I was going to hang myself and then I was diagnosed with BPD. The ending of the relationship hurt so much as I could never believe because I feel like I can't even make friends, let alone be in a relationship, I am discarded by people as if I never really meant anything at all. I would have done anything not to have been born, it hurts so much, I look for things just to try and lessen the pain of being alive. I started binge eating over a year ago and I have gained so much weight from it, I managed to stop but then it started again when life got so hard. 

I have nobody in my life, nobody at all, the only person is my mum but she works 70 hours a week and I barely see her. When I make friends I think I just try to fill the need of never feeling wanted or loved so when I take and take and always want them to speak to me or send me messages and show me the same amount of love it devastates me. It feels like I'm just an empty shell of a person, the only thing that is inside of me is just burning pain. I can't take always being alone and I don't even know if my dad would go to my funeral if I ended my life today. I don't know if more than 10 people would be at my funeral and they would be people who haven't seen me in over a year.

I have realized how the modern era has just added more stress to everyone‚Äôs lives. Think about it, back about let‚Äôs say 50 years ago depression was a rarity. I think the big reason why depression has become so huge is because of the internet, now i‚Äôm not saying the internet is some horrible thing that was made by satan, but it effected everyone in various ways. Let‚Äôs face it a lot of stuff in this world is sad and horrific and since we have the internet we just can‚Äôt avoid hearing about these things, after all ignorance is bliss! Now you probably don‚Äôt want to hear why depression has become so common because that‚Äôs not helping anybody but what I do want you to know is no matter how dark things look, no matter how hopeless it may seem, don‚Äôt give up hope.

It seems not that I reject life or that I flee from it, but that, I am incompatible with it. 

I graduated college some months ago. Dean's list all four years, magna cum laude. I felt nothing. The day I was supposed to walk I hid under my blankets and cried. I wasn't sad to leave my friends behind. I wasn't anxious about my future, my career prospects.  While my friends threw parties and reminisced and made tearful Facebook posts about their experience and their futures, there was nothing in me but emptiness. That's why I cried. I looked back on my life, my many accomplishments, and realized that I was fundamentally broken. A human must feel something, anything, but I felt nothing. I feel nothing. 

There is nothing in me but discontent. It isn't just that I feel nothing, but that I *am* nothing. My personality isn't real. My emotions aren't real. I am not a real person. I am more an automaton meant to imitate human life. Wanting nothing, feeling nothing, built only to do as expected.

58619,"Is There Really No Other Choice?I was... well, not *abused*, but mistreated within a special education program for basically my entire time in school. I was taught I was stupid before I was taught my ABCs. I'm a senior in high school now, been depressed and on-and-off wanting to die since 3rd grade, but trying my best nonetheless. I kept it a secret until I was in middle school, but my parents (especially my mom) haven't really taken my side outside of putting me in therapy. They've done this thing for years where they say I can tell them anything, so I spout out about how badly the program was run and what it's taught me, only for them to defend the *program* over me. Recently I called my mom out on it, but then she made it about her. Her main priority was telling me that I better not be running my mouth to my friends (that I don't talk to or see) about her and that she's ""not going to say she's a terrible mom,"" like I even asked her for that. Therapy helps, but I only go like every other week and it's really, REALLY not enough. I still think I'm a retard. I still know I'm not gonna go anywhere in life if I'm so piss poor at school. And I still know I can't rely on my parents in those 2-week gaps.

I wanted to just deal with this by putting that aside and loving my parents anyways, but a lot of resentment has built up. They did almost everything else right for me as a kid but they've consistently dismissed me every time I said something about ableism making my life hell and my G O D has resentment built up. I hate hiding it, too. But this is the only way to deal with this; doing therapy with them isn't gonna fix it. That, and I don't WANT to run after their love through having ""talks"" in therapy. If 6 years of me telling them how I feel through tears and anger isn't gonna work, and my older brothers standing up for me, then what will?! My therapist acting like a mediator won't save me for the bullshit my mom'll probably spout the second we get into the car afterwards. She's not gonna listen! She's incapable and no one but me sees that! 

There's only one way to make this better though, and I don't want to do it because it's terrifying and I could die.  I have this plan to sneak outside one night with 2 bags packed for a trip to the psych ward. I'm going to walk to the train station and maybe sit on the ground with my legs dangling over the tracks. There's a suicide note already prepped for my parents to see; I'll be sliding it under their door when they're asleep. I'm gonna be really scared and I'm going to force myself to contact a helpline and tell them what I've been doing and that I'm waiting for a train but that I don't wanna do this. Which isn't a lie. They'll have to call the cops on me to take me to the hospital, which I'm already prepared for. Whether or not I'll *actually* attempt and get fully in the tracks or not depends, I guess. But yeah, I'll have to stay in the hospital and then psych ward for a while, and hopefully I can get the help I need there. Not to mention that the scare will make my mom listen. If I actually die, the end effect is the same. 

I wrote the letter this morning and I'm scared to try. I don't know what to do. I know it's extreme and manipulative but I swear this is probably the only way to fix set things right with me and my mom. I always have to do crazy shit to make the adults in my life actually stop and pay attention. For example, I broke a bully of mine's VERY expensive phone in 7th grade in an attempt to get suspended because the entire class was treating me like shit and no one was doing anything. And it worked, my guidance counselor was horrified.

I find distractions over and over to carry me forward, but nothing sticks; and if I don't have one, I usually end up crying hysterically and reminisce on my life pre-transition.

47843,"100% FREE TUTORING, on twitch for the next hour or so. Seriously, come ask about anything you need help with. Math, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Anatomy, Astronomy are all my specialties.  

Right off the bat, this is 100% completely free. I don't ask for donations and I don't want donations. I am so committed to this that I have promised to donate any money received to charity, and I'll post the receipt on the discord to prove it.

Now that's out of the way, Hi! I'm Arch, a college graduate waiting to get into medical school. In this next year I want to give back a little bit to the community and thought that tutoring could be a useful service to offer. My sister is a teacher, and she's told me that the pandemic has been really hard on a lot of students. That is why I am offering office-hours-style tutoring on twitch. I figure twitch is a good way for people to show up and ask questions without needing to sign up and lose their anonymity. I am a neuroscience major with a minor in astronomy. That means I have plenty of experience with the core three sciences and can (hopefully) help explain some of the more difficult concepts to you should you need some assistance.

Again, this is not for money or for karma or for clout. Show up for twenty minutes, ask a question, and leave without a second glance or follow or whatever. This is supposed to be a no pressure environment where students can get some additional help if they need it. Come and check it out if you want or send the link on to a friend if you know they are struggling with something in school. Absolutely no personal information is required. No names, no emails. Jump on twitch and ask a question in the chat, or follow the link to my discord in case you need to post a picture of a problem etc. There are no stupid questions. All I ask is that you be kind and courteous to anyone else in the stream and that you forgive me if I cannot answer your question.

(I am not going to do your homework for you. Just want to help with conceptual issues.)

The twitch is [twitch.tv/archexplains](https://twitch.tv/archexplains)

And you can find more information in my website [archexplains.org](https://archexplains.org/)

I want this to be a resource that anyone can use for a quick question or for in depth help. If you have any ways that I could improve the service please do not hesitate to let me know. Seriously, I just want to help, I know how frustrating these subjects can be when you feel like you need to teach them to yourself.",non-suicide

52727,"Been depressed for the past 3 years and for the first time I am really considering killing myselfBasically it all started in my Junior year of high school when I got suspended for 4 days for showing up to my Homecoming dance drunk. It was not even my fault that I got caught, my friend was too drunk to even make it inside and got stopped by a cop outside the main entrance, he then ratted out me and 3 of my other friends. So I get suspended for that and my parents are FURIOUS at me. I get yelled at for literally 3 hours following the incident and my parents ground me for a year. That's right, a year... I was not allowed to go out for a year and basically lost all of my friends. Well I didn't really lose my friends but I never felt as close to them as I once was. This is what started my depression. I felt so sad every single day of my life. Getting out of bed was the hardest thing in the world and school just fucking sucked ass for me. I would just go in and hear all my friends talk about all the fun stuff they did that weekend and I'm just kind of there, not being able to relate to any of their experiences or anything. However, this situation was not all that bad. I ended up getting really good grades that year and picked up producing music as a hobby. And with my improved grades I was able to get into, what I thought, was my dream University, the University of Wisconsin Madison. However as time went on I started to get more and more into producing music and at some point I remember I decided that this is what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to study Audio Engineering and I did not tell my parents that though because I knew that they would not support me (which will turn out to be the biggest regret of my life). My parents are the classic hardcore conservative, religious, type of people and they pushed me and pushed me to pursue something that would get me a job. I was moderately interested in Computer Science so they pushed me to do that and so I decided that was what I wanted to do in college, even though deep down, I KNEW it was not what I wanted to do. But I didn't really care, I just wanted to go to college and enjoy the University experience. Fast forward a year and my parents finally let me out of the house again. Needless to say, once I had freedom again, I went a little overboard. I started smoking weed every day and going out and getting drunk every weekend. My parents would catch me repeatedly and our relationship just got worse and worse and worse. They started to despise me more and more. Needless to say by the end of the Summer, our relationship was in absolute shambles as I went off to college. But I didn't really care. It's college fuck yeah I don't have to see them anymore, freedom!

So I go off to Uni and things just get worse. I was so happy to be finally relinquished of my parents control and, again I went a little bit over the top. I started to just not give a fuck about school and started smoking and drinking almost everyday. I joined a fraternity and that was just the end of it. About halfway through my first semester I get caught for smoking inside my dorm room. I get a ticket for paraphernalia (which got dropped thank God) and I get in trouble with the university but its not really a big deal since it was my first time. I just had to take this marijuana awareness class online and that was it. It was around the time of this first offense that my mind set started to kind of change. I realized that I hated what I had become. At this time I had not really been depressed for a while but it slowly started to come back. I just did not give a fuck about learning about Computer Science, it was not interesting to me at all and I knew at this point that I needed to get the fuck out of this University and regain control of my life and reach my original goal that was still deep down inside me, to study Audio Engineering and producing. I just felt like a fucking loser all the time. My grades were absolute shit. I ended up getting a 2.4 GPA that semester. Finally towards the end of the semester, I tell my parents that I want to transfer schools and that I am not interested in anything I am learning about at University. After a long talk my parents finally agreed to support my dreams. I go home for Christmas break and my parents find out about my grades and have a long talk to me about how my life is heading, I made my Mom cry and that was kind of like the ""woah I really fucked up moment."" I felt like such a fucking idiot. My parents do all this shit for me and work their asses off so I can get a good education and I just threw it all away like an ungrateful little shit. This is where my depression started to hit overdrive. I was always so angry at myself. I started to smoke weed everyday to cope with my depression over break and they caught me again like 5 days before I went back to school. At this point they had just lost all hope for me, or so it felt like that. When they confronted me about it, I had never seen my parents so defeated. I wanted to kill myself, I felt so shameful. I gave my parents a heartfelt talk about how I will change at University and give up pot and drinking and all of that and focus on school so I could transfer to learn Audio Engineering. They agree to let me transfer so long as I get a 3.5 GPA and stay out of trouble and for once, I feel that they have faith in me again. Well I got back to school with this mindset and I follow the limits I set for myself... for the most part. I just can not give up weed. I gave up drinking (which was not that hard, I never really liked drinking anyway) and started to do really good in school (still am) but then... some incidents occur. I get caught, 2 more times for smoking weed in the dorms like a fucking idiot. The university puts me on probation and I have to go to a counseling center as a form of punishment. They threatened to call my parents but I begged and pleaded for them to not and was able to get out of that. After this situation is when I really started to change. I stopped smoking weed after these 2 incidents and started to devote all of my time to my music and school. Fast forward to the weekend of 2/24, I go to visit my friend who lives in Marquette to take a break from all the studying I had been doing. I get a call at around 11 from my buddy on the floor below me who says cops are searching around his floor and he asks me if he can put his weed in my room because he thought it smelled and didn't want to get busted. I explain to him my situation and ask him to take full responsibility if something were to happen. Well something happened and I get an email the Monday I get back from Marquette from the University saying that they smelled pot coming out of my room and that I had to meet with them again. My buddy sends them an email taking responsibility for the pot but yet they still ask me to meet with them. I just got back from my meeting and they did not believe me and now I am probably going to get kicked out of my dorm and they are going to call my parents and tell them about all my past offenses.

I've been crying for the past 2 hours because of this, I dont even remember the last time i've cried and have never felt so depressed in my entire life. I feel like the biggest fuck up in the entire world. I am actually seriously considering killing myself just so I do not have to deal with the disappointment of my parents. I cannot even fathom the future. I am going to be stuck in Madison learning about shit I don't give a fuck about or my parents are going to make me move back home and ill have to live with them and go to a university around where they live (they are in New Jersey). I don't have anyone to talk to here or anywhere for that matter about this. I do not feel close to anyone. I hate it here. I have no true friends here, school is stressful is fuck and I just feel like a fucking moron now because I just completely jeopardized the one thing that was keeping alive and sane, transferring and pursuing production. I lost any faith I have left in humanity. I try to live a better life and yet no one believes me or gives a fuck. I will try to explain this to my parents but they will not believe me. They really thought I changed my life for the better and now they are going to hear about all of this stupid shit I did and it won't mean anything to them. All of my other brothers are so successful which makes everything 10000x worse. My two oldest brothers graduated with a 4.0 and both have jobs. My little brother is a star athlete in High School and is going to get a scholarship to play lacrosse at one of the top university's in the country. And what have I accomplished? Nothing. I'm a stupid fucking pothead who can't fucking learn when to stop. I don't know what to do at this point but killing myself is honestly sounding like a better option at this point. I just feel so alone in the world and just feel like everything is working against me. I don't know what to do anymore and I don't want to live in a world anymore where I feel so alone with no one to talk to and where my parents feel nothing but dissapointment in me.

Mainly i haven't been feeling the best around these days idk what it is. Stress maybe? Maybe i am just another spolied teen. whatever it was i dont like doing school work and i have been coasting along on c's. Well i didnt do a project for school and was going to do it after it was due except the fact my teacher decided to call my parents. Well knowing full well my parents were going to ground me because not only did i get an F in english but the week before i crashed the car into a ditch. Wasn't too big of damage but my parents were still angry of course. i fuck up way too much lately. 

So I went back to my seat and just thought of ways to kill myself. I really dont know why my first thoughts was killing myself. Its not like my life is shitty. I have lots of friends, i smoke weed when i want, and i am pretty creative i think. I knew how to plan it too my suicide that is. I really was going to do it too. I was gonna use vicoden and some rum in the basement. I had it all out while my parents went for a walk. But i didnt do it, i just put it back.

My mother was there for me but she separated herself from the family, in terms of living conditions, which I totally understand. So I live with my grandparents. My father was cool and I loved him but he was a huge dick to my grandparents, he would curse them out and just be an asshole to them the hole time while I was growing up. He never gave me anything which in hindsight seems completely fine. But he always promised me stuff and always failed to deliver. He was a bum, when it was someone's birthday or we had guests over, he would just stay in his room, sleeping. He was like this most of the time, so I never got the full father experience, go outside, teach me how to do basic thing likes change tires restart a circuit breaker etc. I dont even think he know how to do them. I have this distinct memory of when I invited my friend over and my dad walked out in nothing but shit stained underwear, which was extremely embarrassing and still is, but now I look back and laugh. He would always play the victim, like when I was 13 he kept stealing my fries and one time when I was eating them, I told him no more, and he called me a fatass and said I hope you choke on them, maybe I shouldn't have been a dick but it still was really hurtful and ended up crying in the bathroom for about an hour. Now, about a year ago, he met this girl and they instantly fell in love, and I was extremely happy for him. They would take for hours on end and even introduce me to her. She was nice but I was more use to my real mom so were not super close, but we still fuck with each other. He ended up moving in with her after about a year of them dating, she lives in Rhode Island btw, and took off without saying goodbye to anyone but me. She has 3 kids (9F, 14M, 16F) and they're all cool but I dont really know them. I'm happy that they got a father because they grew up without them, but it kinda sucks that some kids I've never met a getting my father, meanwhile I'm stuck, basically the man of the house who provides like 1/3 of our income. I've had to grow up so fast, I was robbed of my childhood and I cant help think that my dad left me for a girl.

later she told me we were going to the doctor this weekend so i can get a referral to see a psychiatrist, even though i didn't want to as i've been to therapy before and it didn't help. this was where i lost it

i got mad and said i didn't want to go and she couldn't force me. she because angry and said she could, because she's my mother. (she always uses this as an excuse and it pisses me off so much)

lastly, she asked me to come outside for a hug, which i didn't want, so i went back inside to eat. she came to the door and forced me to hug her.i explained that her making me hug her made me uncomfortable, then i also explained that her forcing me in an uncomfortable situation doesn't show me she cares for me and wants to help me like she said when i was self harming. she became more angry and said that she's making me go to the doctors, when i constantly said i didn't want to.

The Parental Controls thing is alright, because it blocks off the no-no websites from me, but the thing that I ABHOR is the time limit.

My parents have always been wonderful in trying to support me, even though I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends, especially not any close ones, the ones I do have are still nice to be around. I‚Äôm just a middle class white guy, no real personality, just kinda drifting through life with no real aspirations or goals. 

I find self destructive practices and stress are the only thing that make me feel alive anymore.

Nor do I want to leave knowing those I leave behind will have to take on the guilt and shame that comes with losing a loved one.

I‚Äôm just so torn. What‚Äôs the point to living. Do things actually get better. I‚Äôm seeing a therapist at the end of the month, but I just figure he‚Äôll tell me to get a hobby. Focus on things that make me happy. If nothing really makes me happy, why even try.

He‚Äôs going to therapy and taking meds for his disorders. While he‚Äôs been depressed, it‚Äôs been manageable and hasn‚Äôt caused me to worry too much. But lately he‚Äôs been scaring me to the point I‚Äôve been having panic attacks.

His depression has gotten worse and about 2 weeks ago he told me he was going to kill himself but didn‚Äôt because I was practically begging him not to. He didn‚Äôt bring up anything suicide or self harm related until yesterday. Actually yesterday was a pretty good day. He asked me on a date for saturday and I could tell he was happy. But report cards came home and he didn‚Äôt do to well. His parents yelled at him and took his phone so we couldn‚Äôt talk for the rest of the night. This morning at school he told me he felt like he‚Äôs been letting everyone down lately and that he almost committed last night. He punched himself and got a black eye and almost cut himself (which he hasn‚Äôt done in years. You can‚Äôt even see the scars anymore).

At 12:47 pm he cancelled our date plans which I hope was related to him feeling sad and not him planning on committing. Then at 6:47 pm he texted me saying he wasn‚Äôt dead. We usually text throughout the day so I was relieved after hearing from him again. I responded like 10 minutes later but I haven‚Äôt gotten a text back. It‚Äôa been almost 3 hours. He‚Äôs a really fast texter so this is out of character for him.

I cant get the thought out of my mind that he might be dead right now. I literally do not know what I will do without him in my life. For the past 6 years, he‚Äôs been my rock. He‚Äôs my favorite person and I love him so much. I wouldn‚Äôt know how to function without him. Can someone please convince me that he isn‚Äôt or hasn‚Äôt killed himself?",suicide

56512,"The mask we wearI attempted suicide a month ago. I've been inpatient, partial inpatient, and now intensive outpatient (supposedly I'm bipolar type 2/severe depression). I have talked about ""wearing a mask"" every single day at work (while I'm in therapy). I put on my bright smile for my patients and my coworkers. No one knew what was coming.

The ""mask"" is what we ""wear"" everyday to get through the day and make everyone think we're okay, even though we aren't. We don't want people to worry, or we don't know how to ask for help, or maybe we think they don't want to hear about it.

The mask is how we hide our shame of being depressed.

I feel like my mask has shattered, and I have been laid bare. I can't gather the strength for a smile anymore for anyone. My days bleed together. I feel like therapy isn't working, or maybe the medications they put me on aren't working. I know I have an amazing support system, but getting through the day is just a hassle. Once I get home from therapy (it's 3 days a week for 3 hours now that I'm intensive outpatient), I lay down and turn on YouTube to watch other people play video games, because I can't even muster the energy to play a video game myself. Than I stay in bed the rest of the day. If I think about it, I might eat something. I'm down to maybe one meal a day. 

I drastically changed my hair the other day. I bleached it, than dyed it 4 different colors. I've been thinking about just packing a bag and disappearing, maybe going to the Appalachian trail and just walking. I don't care what happens to me.

I have been contemplating suicide again. I've been gathering information about where I went wrong last time. I've even told my therapist what I was doing, how I was gathering information so I didn't mess it up next time. She only asked me if I had a plan, which I told her I did not, and it was only thoughts at the time. I don't know what I'm asking for here. I just need to put it out there. I honestly don't care that I'm not using a throwaway even though my roommate (and probably more people) knows my username. At this point, I've just stopped caring about anything.",suicide

No matter what I do, it won't matter; if I take my life, some people might hurt for a while, some will eventually hate me or become indifferent to me, but it doesn't matter, I am dead, and they will be too, shortly. Maybe they'll survive 50 year, maybe they will die tomorrow, but they will all die.

People avoid me because I am too much of a burden. My ex-wife divorced me because I was too much of a burden. Even when I try therapy, people find that I am a burden.

Everyone at school hated me growing up; at work, people only tolerate me because of my technical expertise.

My grand father, who is also my namesake, died because he believed he could walk on water while he was still a young adult.

Maybe he understood it all, maybe he understood that life is meaningless and to take one's own life makes no difference. Or maybe he truly believed he could walk on water; maybe he was just mentally ill because some of the molecules in his body were in the wrong place. I don't know, I'll never know because he is gone. He no longer exists and remains but a weak memory in my father's mind and in my grandmother's mind. But those memories will be gone soon as death will come for them, as death will come for me.

What's the point of even trying to live if everything I do will not matter and will be forgotten ? At any moment, a blood vessel killing me in minutes, I could drown trying to walk on water, I commit suicide because the wrong amount of serotonine and dopamine was produced in my head, I could get in a fatal car accident because 1/100th of a second I was not paying attention and I lose control of my vehicule, I could walk and get hit by a car, I could die of any number of diseases that exist. I could die because any one of the billions of cells in my body suddenly decides to replicate itself out of control. There could be a misfolded protein floating in my blood that could reach the wrong part of my brain tomorrow morning and I could be dead within weeks. There is an infinite number of ways for me to die, and no way for me to live. Any attempt at living will only prolong my inevitable death.

And when I die, and no matter how I die, people will be temporarily inconvenienced for a short time before they too eventually die, and I'll be lost forever just a statistic on a graph that will be lost in 100 years.

Friends, psychologists, psychiatrists, doctors, family, suicide hotlines, they all pretend that things can get better, that I can live. But I can't live, death is coming. And it may be lurking around the next corner, or it might be down the street, it might be growing inside of me and I don't even know.

So why should I actively work to prolong a meaningless life on a meaningless rock floating in a meaningless galaxy ? Why should I try and live another 30-80 years if I will eventually die anyways ?

I've tried making friends, talking to family ( I feel more and more of a burden to them ), I've spoken with counsellors, psychologists, psychiatrists, suicide hotlines, therapy groups, but they can't help, they pretend that there is meaning where there is none, they pretend there is worth when there is none.

They say that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. They are right, life is temporary and death is permanent. But I will die, that is certain.

But most of all, somehow they think that it is my choice that the universe is indifferent and meaningless. They think I can chose whether my life has meaning or not, but there is only one choice: do I go out on my terms or do I live in fear that when death comes it will be slow and painful ?

51824,"i dont even know what im trying to achieve hereI posted 2 or 3 times in subreddits like this before. In the most recent one i actually tried to say goodbye ( to people i dont know, i guess i wanted to tell somebody at least)and end my life afterwards.
I have told the story of my depression in those posts before. I tried to end my life after the last post and woke up in my own vomit. I did not succeed, tho im not sure if i even tried honestly.
Im scared to try again and hate myself even more because i cant even kill myself without crying for attention on reddit. I am crying for attention here, i cant irl. I cant open up to people i know in personal i try to hide my depression.
Trying to hide my depression actually sometimes distracts me from my depression but as soon as im alone i drop into a hole again.
It feels like every meaning of existing is being sucked away from me.
I dont cry everyday or something like that, its just a feeling of not wanting to be alive.

In case none of you have known about this, before 2014 you could play online with people from around the world on some games for the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS Systems. Then, they decided to shut it all down on May 20, 2014. That was the last day you could play online with anyone in any Nintendo game that had online features. Here is an article from before this date in 2014 [https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/the-day-the-mario-kart-died-nintendos-killswitch-and-the-future-of-online-consoles/](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/the-day-the-mario-kart-died-nintendos-killswitch-and-the-future-of-online-consoles/).  This terrible event effected 2 of Nintendo's most popular racing videogames: Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart DS. And, if I'm not mistaken, you probably still own the at least one of these consoles (if not, you're missing out on even the offline games), along with a game that used this online capability feature in the before time. I, for one, loved playing with people on the internet. If you're not familiar with how Mario Kart Wii Online worked, you voted for maps, then you played a Gran Prix. Same with the DS version. I think, I'm not sure, but I think you could actually play with someone on a DS from a Wii. So, it would be deeply appreciated if you could sign up.

61181,"Honestly just considering printing this out and using it as my ""note.""The depression and loneliness and bitterness I have come to experience recently has transcended any sort of emotional pain I have ever experienced in my life prior to this. I have never been more traumatized, frustrated, and angry at myself and everyone else. I essentially hate everything about myself, many things about others, and everything about my life and the choices I've made and the circumstances I've been placed into. 

Being the unwilling subject of a breakup is just about the worst possible experience I think I could have undergone at this point in my adult life, and my self esteem, energy, and happiness is now in the toilet. School and work used to give me a sense of fulfillment; now they only stress me out. I have no considerable talents or contributions to make to anyone or anything in this world. I used to consider living on my own as an accomplishment; now I consider it a burden. I have no strength left to meet new people, express myself, or even attempt to move on from being left in the cold not once, but twice in the last 2 years. 

The loneliness and heartbreak and frustration I currently feel is overwhelming me to the point of desperation. I have begun to lash out at those whom I love, I have begun to engage in self-destructive behavior, and I no longer recognize myself when I look in the mirror. I don't remember how to have a good time anymore. I don't even remember how to be happy. I'm literally going crazy without my ex, whom I still love with all my heart and whom I miss like no other. It breaks my heart knowing he couldn't care less about how I feel, or what's been happening to me as a direct result of abandoning me. I hate where I am in life, I hate that I have to work so hard just to survive when my peers and friends are living the easy life. I hate that while I'm sad and alone and miserable that those who have given up on me are leading happy, fulfilling, active lives, never looking back on what they had with me. 

I've lost count of how many friends I've said ""goodbye"" to in the last year. I fully realize that I'm shoving away those who try to help me. It's not personal. It's just that 1) I have no strength anymore to go on with my life and 2) There really isn't anything anyone could say or do to help me or make me feel better at all. I feel completely alone in this pain, and like I'm ""circling the drain,"" so to speak. I get up in the morning, go to class, go to work, and do whatever else I need to do but I'm empty inside now. My life has only gotten more stressful and thanks to my ex, now I have to face everything alone. And I honestly feel like I can't. I have no one on my side anymore. I have no one to lean back on. I have no one to run into their arms and forget I ever had a bad day. 

God has forsaken me long ago, and my family is over 1,000 miles away. I haven't seen them since Christmas and won't see them again until May. I can't afford therapy, medication, or counseling. The friends I have are tired of my depression, my meltdowns, and my bitterness. I see no change in circumstances in the near future or anything happening that would make me feel as if my life were going any better. I'm having panic and anxiety attacks, I'm banging my head against walls, I've been getting excessively intoxicated by myself, and I've started smoking again.

I continue to struggle with the most basic of daily functions. I've called off work, skipped classes, and lapsed on my obligations because the only thing I have the sheer energy to do is sit around and think about how miserable I am. I'm so sexually frustrated and pent up as well. I'm cooped up, lonely, and bored in my apartment in a ghetto neighborhood that was all I could afford. My bank account is bleeding. I just don't care anymore. I have already accepted that I'll never meet anyone else, and for good reason. No sane person would ever want to be with me, or even get with me. I'm going to work 30 or 40 years and die broke and alone. 

I'm broken and I don't know how to fix myself. I've fallen and I can't get back up. I hate myself and I hate my life. And there's nothing I can do but sit here and rage. Fuck everyone who has hurt me, you'll all regret it when I'm gone.",suicide

6-8 months ago, I was at the worst of my depression. I lived alone and no one would visit me, despite my numerous attempts to avoid being alone. Many people had voiced their hatred for me, especially my ex boyfriend who had only recently broken up with me at the time and used my love to stroke his ego. Any time I tried getting better, things got worse tenfold. Every waking moment, I spent intoxicated but the people that knew didn‚Äôt show concern. After a night of extremely heavy drinking and self-harming, I knew I was completely ready to do it. I called a friend of my ex boyfriend‚Äôs who had remained kind to me throughout our breakup and kept it lighthearted by saying I was feeling ‚Äúdown‚Äù while I prepared myself.
We spoke about his aspirations, what he was doing with his life, how his girlfriend was. He had absolutely no idea that within 10 minutes, I‚Äôd be ending the call and my life.
I ended the call and went to hang myself, and after feeling guilt for making a friend think I was okay, I decided just before losing consciousness to save my own life. I was taken to a hospital and in the hours I sat in the waiting room for my evaluation, I realised that even though no one seemed to really care, I still felt love for people I could never express it to.
I feel love for you, regardless of what you do with your life, because I understand how it feels to be where you are. I‚Äôve lost people I loved more than anyone to suicide, but they weren‚Äôt selfish. They were hurting.

I don't like the very few friends that I have that I see on a regular basis. We just don't click on any level. The friends that I do have that I like live far outside the country and while I think of them of friends I don't feel they feel the same. Everyday is a fucking struggle. I manage with school but I just feel empty inside. I've been thinking more and more about killing myself. It'd be nice to not have to feel this way anymore and to just be free of all of this. But another half of me wants to seek help. However I know that if I want to get help I have to tell my parents. I'm worried about how they'll react. I'm pretty reclusive so they don't know much about me and the last thing I want them to see is the side of me struggling to find the will to live. I've thought about just going up to them and telling them I want to see a therapist but I chicken out right at the last second. I'm so pathetic I can't even get help.,suicide

My whole childhood was me by myself or just at school miserable. My brother got me out of the house and I just I've been getting help for a couple months with a teen help center, nothing has changed. They put me on zoloft and I take it every day just to feel nothing and get drowsy.I just hate human beings, every friend group I ever been in I leave because I realize I just dont like anyone.

52829,"So sick of being abnormalHey wanna hear my story? 

So I was born with minor deformanities and had to undergo surgery when I was one. This made me being scared of strangers. And until age of five I lived in the the woods so I met no friends. I'm an only child.

Then we moved and I got enrolled into nursery. I was always ill and coughing so I needed extra care. I was unsocial and stuff so pretty much everyone hated me. Teachers picking me kids bullying me etc. Even at this young I did abnormal things such as attempting to kill someone else blah. And I think I might have been touched but I'm not sure. I do remember being way too oversexualised. 

Primary school. Got two friends. I treated them so badly - I practically bullied them. I just didn't know how to approach them but wow I was so mean. They didn't like me anyway. I remember being separated at second grade and being so jealous and sad. Welp then at third grade I moved again. I got bullied there for being ugly. Didn't have friends until next year - had a nice friend. I made another friend in summer. That friend told my ex friend lies and stuff. They started bullying me. Blah blah blah. First suicide attempt.

Secondary school. I didn't talk for a year as I was so sick of relationships. People talked behind even though they didn't even know my name. I was so famous for being ugly that boys from other classes would hop over just to see my face. A boy said I was the most ugliest being he's ever seen to his friends and I happened to hear it. Hurt me deep. From this point I couldn't look at mirrors. I still cannot dare to. Plus second suicide attempt.
Then I decided to be brave and come forward. Did make friends but was always circling outside. And with my strange behaviours everyone again started hating me. I think this is when I realised I was quite autistic. Aspergers (ASD) to be precise. I'm not sure though, I can't take therapies since my parents won't let me (they're abusive). Also I started sleeping more than 12 hours a day and had massive trouble waking up. And yes self harming.

But that year was a huge achievement to me. I started talking again. I worked hard and lost weight (15kgs?). I changed hair styles and stuff and started looking slightly better. It looked good -

The next year. Still kept circling around never fit anywhere. Got sorta molested few times by a boy I knew. Third suicide attempt. I tried hard to lose weight but I couldn't. Developed anorexia. Never got under 58kg.

Highschool. Bam boom pew was chaotic. Made a friend. She was such a selfish person. Couldn't make other friends. Got diagnosed with narcolepsy. Dreams shattered - I wanted to be a pilot. Grades had amazing free fall. Mum started hating me even more. Death threats, not giving me food, hitting me bad, swearing etc. She's always cussing me.

Narcolepsy worsened. Pills started showing extreme side effects. Mental health was just broken into pieces. I had to deal with being hated by everyone even my parents (I'm pretty sure I'm autistic and with my personalities I get to be hated). PTSD from sexual incidents. Loneliness. Abnormally extreme nightmares/hallucinations and other behaviours from narcolepsy. I could get no help. Parents would just call me out lazy or stupid and never got me into therapy even though tests at school told me I was mental. And especially my mum she once saw me attempting suicide. Wanna know what she said? ""I didn't know you were brave"".

And you know I'm just so ugly and I found talking to someone so hard. I couldn't go outside because I was completely ashamed of how I look and my personalities.  By the way I did report my parents. They said they could talk to my parents and tell them they're treating me badly. Nope.

I have PKD (Polycystic Kidney Disease). Because of this I have stage 4 chronic kidney disease, there are 5 in total.  Being in stage 4, I have to have dialysis 3 times a week for 4 hours (not including travel.)  I was bullied a lot for having my central line (tubes sticking out under my collar bone used for dialysis) and because of my speech impediment (my r's sound like w's(Rhotacism.))  Due  to this, I fled into the internet during my childhood to meet new friends, because of this I have lied to many of them, eventually resulting in  them finding out about my lies and them ending the friendship.  I lie to hide the stuff that bullied me, to give me more self confidence, and to sound cool.  I never had a bf/gf, a date, or a kiss.  I feel worthless and a burden to everyone.  I do not have my drivers licenses (assumed i wouldn't live to need it) so since I was a child i had to have someone drive me to and from dialysis (with them waiting) for a total of 5 hours wasted.  My parents hate each other and are only still ""married"" due to me.  My siblings have picked up some bad vices which i blame myself for because of the attention i stole from them.  My mom quit her job because of my dependence of the dialysis transportation.  My mom blames my dad for him ruining her career and for lying about a promise of a beach cottage (because of me can't get one.)  Recently i have been trying not to be depressed by trying online dating, and playing league of legends.  It didn't work good.  When I was online dating, it just made me lie to more people to cover myself up, i feel bad for it, i have since quit it, but i have one dude added on league who gifted about $10 worth of goods.  It's not like I get announced ""hey ill but you (BLANK)"" it happened randomly and I get happy, because its exciting but then I feel terrible because I was happy for it and I don't deserve it.  I didn't plan this post ahead of time so sorry if my sentence structure isn't good.  Also I have trust issues, I DON'T KNOW WHY! I deleted my friend (who i met from here with my first post) 2 times because i became dependent on him, he wants me to open up to him, but I can't  I just feel better when I talk to people I don't know.  Recently I've been having a hard time sleeping and been crying alot when my parents yell at each other.  It's my fault for them being forced together and even for them hating each other now!  Another depressing thing is that if I have kids, there is a 25%ish chance they will have the same kidney problems (assuming I live and get a transplant, 1 year expected waiting left)  But I never even been on a date, so i doubt ill ever get married.  I'm so ugly and retarded with my impediment.  I suck at league too, the guy i met from here, I play with his friends all the time and i'm just a level 16 (level 30 is highest level, everything up to it is just learning how to play) and they say i am good, I used to believe them but i think that they just want to make me feel good.  I told him not to tell his friends about my kidney/depression, idk if he did but i hope he didn't.  I'm sorry this is so long.

This is not making excuses for my lack of contributions to society. In fact, i feel dreadful for such a thing, and feel like I‚Äôm taking up valuable space on this Earth for someone with a naturally confident personality. I've never even managed to hold down even one menial job. I wouldn't mind but I am naturally very smart, but at the same time I have very severe mental illnesses. 

Living a normal productive life where I contribute to society is almost impossible for me, and I'm smart enough to recognize that. So why then is it that suicide is generally seen as a negative option? In my scenario this is **NOT** ‚Äúa permanent solution to a temporary problem‚Äù. This illness will ALWAYS be there, like my brain is punishing me for having these dreadful things happen, and I simply can no longer reconcile that.

Let me start by saying this: I know there is a higher being above me who is the cause of all my misfortune. He/she/it decided that my life should just be shitty but not shitty enough for anyone to care about, right? Why the fuck did it have to be me?

And why should I get to be angry? I'm only 16, right? I don't even fucking KNOW how bad life can be. I get it. That doesn't mean all my problems should magically go away just because I'm not middle aged with bills or a stressful job or a midlife crisis. 

No one gives a shit about me. They just pretend to. Every time I complain about my problems or try to vent, no one cares. They just worry about themselves.  I don't get it. I genuinely care about a lot of people and it fucking hurts when they don't feel the same. Sure, I have friends, but they can't help or understand how I feel.. and I know that sounds so cheesy and cliche but I don't care because it is the most accurate way to describe it.

My self esteem never fucking took off like I thought it would when I became a teenager.  Thought I would be living it up.. having tons of friends and going to dances with guys.. boy was I wrong. No one wants to make new friends when they already have their designated group. Sure, I love my friends, but the clique situation at my school is ridiculous. I can't meet anyone new because I'm not popular. I believe I am pretty sometimes but then I realize no guy likes me and obviously there is SOMETHING wrong with me. 

Approximately one guy has ever had a crush on me and he was creepy as hell not to mention never fucking TRIED TO TALK TO ME. I don't get it. The one thing that brings my self confidence up is when I think a guy likes me. every time I delude myself into thinking someone likes me.. I almost have a shred of self confidence for a few seconds.. jokes on me right.. I should know better than that by now.. 

The saddest thing is that I have tried. I push myself too hard and I care too much. I pushed myself to get a part time job.. I pushed myself to get all A's.. and I feel like I'm at the breaking point. I try to be open and friendly but no one reciprocates. I feel like I'm here solely for others. 

None of it matters. It doesn't mean shit if I can't be a fucking SOCIAL BUTTERFLY and not be afraid of rejection. 

Sure, I'll get a good job and get a good salary and what not, but I'll never be truly happy. I have this illusion of being happy, and that's having a boyfriend.. DO NOT TELL ME HOW SHALLOW/CHILDISH/IMMATURE THAT SOUNDS. YOU THINK I DON'T FUCKING KNOW THIS? It's sad, sure. But the feeling of being loved more than a friend, being thought of romantically, that's all I really want... I don't want a hobby. I have those. I don't need to focus on school. I have spent my whole school career pushing myself to get straight A's. Focusing on school will not solve my problems. I just want to feel like someone cares about me. 

I KNOW what you're thinking: ""People on this subreddit have real problems and you are a stupid teenager just complaining about lack of love life. Grow up."" This is what bothers me. Everyone just waves my problems off like they don't matter. No one cares what a stupid teenager has to say. My ""lack of love"" has depleted all my self-esteem and made me suicidal.

I have contemplated suicide on and off since I was about 11. Being bullied and whatnot hasn't helped my self confidence either. Sometimes it gets really bad, like right now, and I feel like drowning. I actually took a bath today and held my breath for as long as I could, just to see if I could do it. But for some reason, I don't have the lady-balls to do it. I feel like there has to be SOMETHING or SOMEONE for me out there. But right now, I don't care much for living through the ""best years of my life"".

Yeah, I don't know what to write, honestly.
I'm just really depressed today. Probably not in the state to write anything decent. 
Not that it matters, since I already wrote my suicide note about 2 weeks ago anyway, so my close friends'll be fine.  
And it still stands. I... don't know how I'll be able to continue on.

Some brief backstory I guess: 
I moved to the US almost 2 years ago. 
I have a history of countless suicide attempts (I lost track how many), but haven't attempted since moving here. 
After moving here, I was staying at someone's place.. let's say, a friend's place. 
Well... that ended. 
So I've been homeless for over 3 months now, and it's... SO FUCKING MISERABLE. 
So cold. So hungry. So lonely....

That loneliness in particular is just... ugh. 
I don't have any friends here near me, so I'm very starved on social interactions. 
It may sound silly, but I'm also VERY starved as far as... touch goes. 
Turning 21 soon, but I'm still a virgin. haha
And it's like.. I look good (I'm female, btw). 
But I have SUCH, SUCH bad social anxiety and I just can't deal with it. 
I'm too shy, too awkward to interact with people in *any* context at all. 
I hate it.
I don't hate myself for being autistic anymore, but I struggle with socializing a lot and it's very difficult.

The only time I'm not insanely anxious is when I use. But continous substance use is not sustainable... hell, I'm poor as fuck, lol.

62553,"Spiraling thoughts, lucid ones, planning in my headSince the past few weeks, l've had ups and downs, with increasing thoughts, some organized, some not.

In the past 4 years: bought a home, acquired 2 stepkids in the process, lost a job, got another one, seen my parents get iller and iller, turned to sports to numb my pain. Wanted to push myself and run a Hal marathon (as a 5'7"" 270 pounds 40 years old man), trained hard, went to vacation with the family, where I was the outsider most of the time. Thank yous for petty stuff had to be pried.

Then my dad told me my mom repeatedly cheat on her, sometimes when she would look after me. He told that when I was 2, our suitcases were at the door but mom convinced him to stay.

After that, my department got cut from 26 to 6 ( I was one of the lucky ones), had a string of bosses as I was changed teams a few times. Ended up with the worst manager for me: screaming, cursing, email scolding and unattainable goals.

In the meantime , both my parents were taking turns at the hospital (free healthcare), my youngest aunt died and I had a breakdown during a meeting with my boss. Doc kept me out of work for 3.5 months with meds and sleeping pills. 

Was meeting with a psychologist but, she threw me a curve ball: she had to stop a few months after, for her maternity leave. Life sometimes finds the best way to slap you hard

Came back and worked three days before learning that my position had been cut during my medical leave.

2 weeks after, I was getting married to my Uni crush, after a few serious relationships on each side.

I spent the summer doing nothing. A luxury that few can have. Found a new job, with better pay and benefits, in an industry that doesn't rock my - or anybody else's world.

Just before Christmas, my godfather passed and my dad spent 4-5 weeks in the hospital from November to now.

Real kicker is here: for the better part of the last 3 years, my wife and I were engaged in assisted procreation. 

Good old-fashioned way extravaganza, ins√©minations and for the last 4 weeks up until now, in vitro fertilization.

Implantation was supposed to be this morning, but my wife had a call: the embryos had stopped developing. 

I will never be a dad...

Shock. Intense and sudden sadness. I had to stop at work before coming back home.

Had to tell myself not to cross the street without looking
Had to stay away from the overpass
Had to tell myself to always touch a station' s wall until the train was stopped
You get the drift.

And there are bursts of ""I cannot take this anymore"" ""what if..."" and other assorted black thoughts.

And there are also bursts of ""me not being here would be best for anybody involved"". 

So I think and rationalize and find rules and restrictions to make suicide so difficult that I won't do it. I'm thinking about methods (co2, pills) that aren't messy, who gets what, letters to friends and family, etc.

Nothing is set in stone, but I would make sure that my wife and stepkids are taken care of. That finding my body would not be a traumatize. Slapping a piece of paper in the entryway. ""Honey, call 911, stay out of this room. They will know what to do""

With a letter to her, to the kids, my parents, my friends, to her future lover too.

If I get to emotional, I may do it in the spur of the moment.
If I think too much, I may plan everything and go along with it.

This or me leaving her are the only long term options I see. Stepson said he was happy that IVF didn't work. Adoption is a no-go because he will be vocal about not being supportive of the idea.

No adoption = me living a resentful, sad life.

That's where I am ATM.

I've thought about it a lot lately and I can't think of a single thing that would make me happy. I'm overweight, freakishly tall, I am constantly used by my family and other people around me, I have no hobbies, I'm a NEET with $5000 worth of debt, I've never been in a relationship or had sex with anyone, and at the end of the day, it's all my fault. I can't remember the last time I felt content with life (except for when I was tripping on psychadelic mushrooms). My mom died when I was 13 and after that, my dad kinda stopped caring about being a good parent. He provided food and shelter but that was about it. I've tried hard to get out of the situation I always find myself in but I always fail because the one constant is me. I'm the problem. I'm a worthless piece of shit who can't do anything right, and though maybe people enjoy being around me occasionally, given enough time they'll learn to despise me. Even if things changed, even if I was making $100,000 a year, with a beautiful wife, and close friends, I still don't think I would be happy. I'm just a broke human being and I can't seem to be fixed, even after years of therapy. I truly believe I was destined to kill myself. I don't know why. I'm not religious, but if there is a god, I'm sure he's laughing his ass off at me. I really wish things were different. I'm terrified of death but at this point I have no choice.

65043,"College student looking for someone to talkMy name is Logan and I‚Äôm 21 years old. I‚Äôm a college student in my senior year about to graduate in May. On the outside, everything in my life seems fine. I‚Äôve got good grades, I go to class, I turn in my homework, I‚Äôm good looking, I think, just a regular guy. 

But I can‚Äôt even remember the last time I was happy. When I was a kid my parents fought and screamed at each other all day every day, so I got away as much as possible. I would bike 5-6 miles just to go to the movie theatre and escape. In high school I ran cross country and track, and I was a normal student, but I didn‚Äôt really have any friends but one. There was one kid who I had known my entire life, literally my best and only friend, but one day he learned when our family was on vacation and broke into our house, stealing a lot of money and trashing the place. He admitted to doing it, and I remember holding my little brother in bed who was crying because he thought that someone was going to break in again. My parents were too busy fighting to care I guess.

So now I had no friends, and it was so hard to meet anyone. Now I think that maybe I have trust issues like I only see the worst in people or something. I can‚Äôt get near anyone because everyone I‚Äôve ever been close to has left or doesn‚Äôt care about me. No one but me. I was really down for a long time, and no one cared. One night I was at the house alone and I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking, I just wanted it all to stop so I didn‚Äôt have to cry anymore. My mother came home and found me right then, like the worst timing in the world, and I was crying with a knife and I told her what I was doing. She made me see this counselor woman, but I refused to talk to her. They sat me in front of some fat, rich, stupid, privileged woman who knew nothing about me and expected me to talk or something, but I just sat there not saying a word for every meeting she made me do.

I went to college, and it was more of the same. I have no friends. I go to class, do my homework, and sit in my room. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs fucking wrong with me but sometimes I hurt myself or go on a walk and punch a brick wall until its covered in blood from my hand. I barely eat anything anymore, I‚Äôm pretty sure I have anorexia. I‚Äôm 5 foot 10 inches and weigh about 110 pounds. Last year I went too long without eating and passed out, hitting my head on the floor pretty bad. I woke up in the hospital and it took me 6 months to recover. It‚Äôs just getting worse. I don‚Äôt want to be around anymore, but I‚Äôm too much of a pussy to kill myself. I‚Äôve tried everything, hanging, cutting, co-2 with a car. I just can‚Äôt fucking do it. I don‚Äôt know anymore. I don‚Äôt know what would make me happy. I guess I just want someone to love me. But no one ever has.

I met a girl last year in school and we hit it off. I‚Äôm still a virgin and I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend, so I‚Äôm a bit shy, but I‚Äôm pretty good looking, so I went for it. For a while things were great, I worked up the nerve to tell her I liked her, and she told me she liked me back. We would sit up all night watching bad movies and talking until the morning. This went on for a while. One day I worked up the courage to tell her I wanted to kiss her and we did, (first kiss at 20 years old is pathetic, I know) and I asked her out. She said no and just left. All the time we spent just wasted. All the times she told me she liked me were a lie I guess. It was crushing. The first friend I‚Äôve made in years just gone. But that‚Äôs what I get for putting myself out there. Just like my old friend when I was young. Now I‚Äôm 21, still a virgin, still have no friends, and I‚Äôm supposed to graduate and find a job, start a life? For the last 8 years I‚Äôve been trying to find a way to die and I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I don‚Äôt know what to do. No one has ever told me they loved me. No one has ever cared. No one even notices me because I look so normal I guess. But I‚Äôm falling apart. I‚Äôm barely eating, I‚Äôm dangerously underweight, and I‚Äôm too much of a pussy to die. 

I don‚Äôt know what the point of all this is, I guess I just have no one to talk to and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt think I can kill myself, but I‚Äôve been trying again recently and it just hurts so fucking bad. I‚Äôm just angry and sad all the time. I feel like I almost can‚Äôt even get up in the morning anymore. Food doesn‚Äôt taste good, even fucking masturbating doesn‚Äôt feel good. I have no one to turn to.

What the fuck do I do? I spend all day putting on a smile so no one at school can tell. I can‚Äôt keep doing this much longer‚Ä¶

He was 61 years old and apparantly his daughter was set to marry that weekend. I don't know why but it hit me so hard. I've been in college for 1,5 years now but I cried when I saw it.

He was such a wonderful man, he was our physics teacher but meant so much more to us students than I can even imagine. He was a kind man, always taught his course with so much passion and hilarity even when we were bored. He was so invested in our school's activities, he sang in the school choir, participated in school plays and accompanied us and entertained us on school trips. On one of my last days of high school, he even told us about how he had stood on the roof of our building to help a depressed student from jumping off. I didn't know how much I appreciated him as a teacher until now, and I feel like shit.

The day after I heard he died, I had to go to college and do a presentation and I fucked it because I started crying in the middle of it. I had to get this off my chest and want to let people know how great of a man he was. Thank you all for listening, and because this is r/teenagers I wanted to remind you high school kids know that if you have any teachers that mean something to you, tell them.

51307,"I can't keep going like this.Might as well give some context, I'm at the end of my rope. Since I was fourteen I've been feeling suicidal and while there were times that I felt better they were very brief. The thoughts went away when I was sixteen and returned when I was eighteen, then they went away for a few months when I was nineteen and came back when I was twenty.

I'm tired of the loop and I suppose, now that I'm in this corner of the web I might as well provide some context. Long story short abusive childhood due to a shitty, psychotic ""dad"", followed by bullying and by bullying I don't mean simple name-calling I mean it was pretty bad. My life was threatened on two occasions and I was used as a human punching bag almost every day of the week while the school supported the behavior. When my mother actually pulled me out of that school they phoned her talking about ""Poor Stephen"", Stephen being the future serial killer who was one of many people in that school that made life there pretty shitty.

When I was in primary school it was my escape from an abusive parent so I was weighed down from two abusive environments and developed depression at the age of fourteen. Yay for me.

I left my abusive ""dad"" at sixteen and two years later failed my exams in college due to not being able to take the pressure mixed with the fact that I felt my life was going in the wrong direction due to his poisonous influence leading me down a path I didn't even want to be on. 

Oh also when I was seventeen going on eighteen I entered an abusive relationship that lasted a year where she convinced me that suicide was an answer. Top this off with her girlfriend (that being the person she left me for) sabotaged the next relationship I was in and just recently harassed me on social media telling me that I was a complete monster.

Seems by her logic I became super duper suicidal for no reason and was the abusive one. Yay. 

Mix this with a family that thinks I lied about the abuse, friends stabbing me in the back or shutting me out of their lives when I need them and two partners leaving me when I chose to open up about the abuse and how I felt and you have a bit of a mess.

But wait, it gets better.

I am terrified of intimacy and my biggest ever fear is having kids as I'm afraid of being an abusive phycopath and breaking someone as even though I spent my entire life trying not to be my father I'm still frightened of it and sometimes I can even hear his voice. 

When I turned 20 in March I took some time to reflect on my life and myself as a person only to find out just how messed up I was in the head and with life in general. Since then I've been getting worse.

Therapy is off the table as due to cutbacks (thanks, David Cameron I hope you die from pig-related AIDS) there is zilch in terms of mental health services and the NHS is in shambles. I was told I had ""circumstantial depression"" when I went for help and just told to ""improve my situation"" 

I have been to three different GPs, all the charities in my country (Northern Ireland) that relate to abuse only deal with women, children and people that were abused by institutions like the church, helplines are just the worst and private therapy would cost me from 50-80 quid not per session but per hour. 

That's something I can't afford with my job and I would rather die in the comfort of my own home by my own hands than die of starvation in the streets of Belfast. 

I'm tired of fighting my depression, I'm tired of fighting the nightmares and the relapses and the fear that comes from the abuse.

I'm just about done but I suppose the reason I'm posting here is becuase there's still a part of me that wants to fight. Maybe it's just self-preservation kicking in again, I don't know for sure. ",suicide

Fortunate enough to have been able to see a private therapist for the past few months. Heck my football team Liverpool looks like they will win the Premier League for the first time in my life.

I've been told many times by people that life gets better but when half of it has been spent in depression and a quarter or it flittering between suicidal or hopeless thoughts, its hard to believe them.

I'm looking up the various ways I would be able to end my life at the moment. I don't want to carry on . Even if I continue living I won't feel happy with it, it would just be existing and there is no point in that. I know its selfish but I just want the pain to end for me.",suicide
53874,"""Anything is better than suicide.""Is it? This is the debate I have with myself in my head day in and day out. I'm on disability for various mental illnesses and have been since 2009. I want nothing more than to be off gov't help completely yet because of how ill I am I may never be able to hold down a job. I dream of going back to college (I am 23, have dropped out a few times), getting a degree and working in a job that is both meaningful and useful and putting my intelligence to work (tested iq at 154, so I'm no genius but kinda smart). 

My dilemma. It's like being (or having the potential to be) a great athlete with a (potentially) permanent injury that specialists debate over the diagnosis and all treatments so far have failed. Except it's my brain. All this time on the sidelines of life watching everything go by, I naturally question whether I really would have been such an awesome athlete after all, or whether the world really needs one more.... (scientist, researcher, academic, lawyer, doctor or whatever to drop the metaphor). Maybe I really am a pathetic waste of space like I always imagined, and maybe that wouldn't change even if I got degrees and a good job I enjoyed. What if even that won't cure my search for meaning?

Aside from that I've got all the standard issue reasons to kill myself as well, history of sexual abuse, neglect, bullying; current social isolation; chronic mental illness with the potential to get worse. I can name 3 people (and 2 cats) who would be geniunely upset to learn of my death, and 2 of them I don't care if I hurt them because they both abused me. The third? My therapist. I'm hanging on for her and for the hope that things will get better, but I'm getting really tired.

Back to the main topic. Is anything really better than suicide? The life I'm living now is barely worthy of being called 'life.' I live alone. I work from home a couple hours a day when I can to supplement disability and food stamps so I can pay rent and bills. I hang out w/ my one friend a couple times a week. I bathe and attend to 
hygiene, do the dishes sometimes, smoke weed or drink at night to calm the anxiety and distract from my elaborate and lethal suicide plans. I go to support groups, but feel like most people ~don't understand me~ and treatments like CBT don't do much because my quandary is on an existential level (as well as the regular old psychotic depression/poss schizophrenia/bipolar 2/unicorn syndrome). Medication like SSRIs, anti psychotics, mood stabilizers/anti convulsants tend to make me worse or do nothing.

I have gotten better. I used to be in and out of the hospital once a year, severely bulimic, socially anxious, emotionally labile and my self esteem was so low when my ex (then bf) asked me to spend the night I slept on the floor because I felt 'unworthy' of the bed. It sounds like ... I don't even know what it sounds like. Now it's been a few years since I was last inpatient, my eating is okay and I don't throw up, my mood has stabilized to the point where my therapist called me 'level-headed' the other day (I almost choked laughing) and I sleep on beds and feel sort of okay about myself.

But still I'm a drain on society, my apartment is a mess and when I say I'm doing the absolute best that I can I mean it. It's the best I can do to merely continue living, and I'm not sure why I should keep going. I asked my therapist if I have any chance of living a normal life. She told me a story about a client of hers who was pretty much like me when he came in. 7 years later he's off gov't assistance and instead has 3 shitty jobs and is still kind of miserable. The joy I have to look forward to after 7 years of hard work... Obviously everyone is different, etc. but this is at least one thing I don't have delusions about: it will take a long time to get better (to the point of a normal or at least enjoyable and meaningful life) and some people never do, or their version of better looks a lot like my life now.

My disability is under review. I'm tempted to not turn in my paperwork, let them deny me or whatever they do so I have a reason to finally catch the bus. I've been waiting at the stop a long time. I've watched people get on; I've tried a couple times but I either got cold feet or didn't have the right amount of change. That won't be a problem now. /emo

tl;dr is my shitty life really better than death",suicide

I can't get up to go to school at all, all I can do is lay in bed until I ache everywhere and most days all that's on my mind is what it would be like if I was dead.
My parents have always been very clear that they did not want me getting on medication for it. I have family members that take medication, but they never wanted that for me. Now, they're actually making me an appointment for it because it's been so bad and now that it's here I'm scared.

I know this probably sounds ridiculous coming from someone who wants to die, but I'm scared about having that on my record and I'm scared about what medication would do to me.
The job that I've always wanted requires good mental health, and having depression and anxiety on my record would put me at the bottom of the list.
I don't even understand my thinking, honestly. I don't think I'll ever make it to the job if I don't get help, but if I get help there's a chance I'll never get the job. I've had the mindset that 'if I don't get this job, there's no point in living' and I'm aware that's bad.

Hello, I‚Äôm transgender female to male. I haven‚Äôt had anything medical done and I‚Äôm in high school. 

The dysphoria and discomfort of not feeling okay in my own skin is so overwhelming, I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I need something to change.. but I‚Äôve done everything possible in order to pass that I know of. I‚Äôve spent hours looking online for something I‚Äôve missed; some secret that guys do in order to actually be seen as a guy. 
I‚Äôve started going to a support group and although it did give me hope, it‚Äôs also made me feel even worse. There‚Äôs this one guy there who‚Äôs already 5 years through his transition, I‚Äôm so envious. 
All I‚Äôve been able to think about this past two months is how many different ways I can hurt myself and utilize the objects around me. I can‚Äôt even tell you how many times I‚Äôve thought about jumping out of my car while doing 60-70 down the interstate.

I‚Äôm so depressed, my medication just keeps going up and I‚Äôm still depressed. I have mental breakdowns regularly. I don‚Äôt sleep much, or I over sleep. I either don‚Äôt eat or eat on and off. I‚Äôm antisocial and awkward. I have absolutely no friends, and I just started at a new school a month ago. 
I tried getting my teachers to call me he/him even at the cost of using my birth name, but I have to get parents permission. I want to start testosterone, but I need both parents signature. My father isn‚Äôt even in the picture, and my mother thinks it‚Äôll all go away over time.

One had terminal health issues but the others just had mental health struggles.

She keeps telling me she's afraid to die, that she's afraid Hell might be real (she was raised catholic but never really believed it) that she doesn't want to leave me, etc. All I hear all day are her pained cries, gurgling sounds because she can hardly breathe, the screams of a 98 year old woman in pain just wrench your heart out. She's reverted back to a childlike state and is very ashamed constantly, she cries every time I change her diaper or bathe her and apologizes that I have to do it. She has trouble talking and struggled so hard just to say ""I love you"" to me and now she just makes pained noises and wails.

Which is fine I suppose, but I don't stay there overnight (her son helps out too) so I kept asking him to come by and talk to me because I really needed someone. He basically said he's over my shit, that I'm ""always bitching"", that I'll never be happy and he's busy with work but apparently trying to make a life for us isn't enough and that he can't deal with me any more because I'm so ""mentally unstable"". I'm going through the most traumatic period of my life and he's never had a person close to him pass away, especially not so horribly. There are other people I could turn to I suppose but he's very close with my family and I wanted to lean on him but he's just tired of me I guess, great timing.

As everyone here can relate to existence being a empty void of darkness I had a glimmer of light shine through at work last night.

Been at this job for a few years now and tonight we were extremely busy in an area I don't work in. Because it's so busy I got to go help out in that area. There is this girl there I have a small crush on that works in that area and she's been there about 2 months more than me and we've never talked before.

Management told her to just start putting everything the conveyor even if it doesn't have a box we need to get this stuff out of here. While she had her doubts, this is what they said to do so she did.

Items got stuck in the belt on the 2nd floor and no one noticed for a while. When I found the shaft to take the boxes to the first floor jammed with about 50 boxes in it I climbed into it and started removing the individual unboxed items and fixed the jam.

So now the question is who in the world would do this? It's my buddy, me and my crush picking skips so I asked my buddy and he said it wasn't him. So it wasn't me..... must be her.

I went over to talk to her as the army of boxes scoot by and I'm like what have you done??? (Sarcastically)

Her face turns red and we start laughing.... I tell her how I had to climb up the conveyor to take stuff out. She tells me how management told her this would be faster. We have some good laughs about how management is dumb and watch the army of boxes go by.

After the conversation work went by as normal but that was a pleasant experience. My first conversation with someone new went well. Nothing awkward happened and it seemed like I wasn't a burden to talk to.

While life has not gone my way I'm still dragging through and I manage to stay long enough for a nice experience like that and maybe I'll look back on it another day when things are low. 



So... this turned out to be a lot longer than I thought and I tried to shorten it a couple times. Sorry guys, hope it cheers someone up.",suicide
53012,"Apparently I can't have opinions now Usually I don't decide what to do in my family, because most of the time I either agreed or I just don't have a strong feeling towards a certain topic.

Recently, I'm so fucking mad.

This is one case of a few this summer, and 1 that really triggers me.

So I have a new cram school class on Wednesday that will make my entire week full except from Sunday, and half a day of Saturday. Originally I went with it, because it's like 3h per day. But I'm going into a new school, so the school requires us to go for half a day everyday during August, and that will leave me with around 4~5h to do what I want per day. 

So far, it's fine for me. But when school starts, these cram school classes still continue, leaving me with pratically no time to rest, maybe about 1h, but I reckon that time would go to homework.

So I disagreed, something I rarely do. However, they heard me, didn't care, and signed up for it anyways. Now, I am fucked. I can do nothing about it other then complain. I'm doing fine so far, but I doubt that'll be the same once school starts. 

#TLDR: My parents don't care about my time to relax, and made me do courses.

Way before this happened, I was already having suicidal thoughts/ideations. I was never diagnosed though and I never had the courage to.
My mother, she was special and I never would deserve her. She was the only one who knew, she was the only one I confided in. I guess now, I don't know. 
I don't exactly know how I feel. Sometimes it hits me, fear. But it's myself I fear. I feel like the only thing stopping me is the thought of my grandmother. She might not make it if I finally get the courage to listen to my impulses.
I guess I can fake it well, but sometimes I just wish someone would notice or care. Funny isn't it? How no one really cares, but they pretend they do. I guess I'm sad, and angry, and tired. Because these past few days, I have been feeling it again but this time, it's stronger.",suicide

46069,"I'm sick of sharpening a nonexistent pencil with a half-hearted handBreaking whatever this is down into terse sentences because otherwise it would be incoherent.

- haven't been diagnosed with anything, but struggled with a melancholic aimlessness ever around the age of seven

- understood that living had no point, but turned it into an excuse not to study and be spoiled

- ten years later: grew up, but it feels like I haven't changed at all and worsened in some aspects

- settled for mediocrity. Forgot or ignored some essential life skills (hygiene, grades, social skills and Determination) that resulted in bullying and a great decline of my already dismal self-esteem

- ""whatever. Keep trudging on. With your inability to do anything right, you'll probably fuck up suicide too.""

- bit by bit, lost interest in previous passions as concentration dithered. Have faint dreams or ambitions, but I don't get or complete them because I can't invest myself into anything. Losing interest in everything else, even the time sinkers. Everything including myself is so vapid and superficial

- be like this until junior year, trying out all those self-help mantras with college on the way (I will Ambition without Wanting! I will Succeed without Putting in 100%!), until the Cancer Nation attacks and takes the only person who (somehow) gave a shit about me: my mother, who raised me alone because my real dad's an abusive asshole. 

- She's one of those people who went to the gym at least four times a week and bought organic vegetables to turn into green juices. She died within the span of a month and spent the last two weeks of her life with little to no brain activity.

- she tried to help me the most, offering lesson after lesson and weekend after weekend just for me, but I fuck that up too and reject her and her love. Was afraid she'd find out and become a bigger problem to her than I already was (am), something she didn't deserve with her working to the bone to get where she was.

- spent January wondering how to get my shit together with no one left to provide and how to eat all the food people keep giving

- spent February fucking up harder than January

- likely spending March sinking deeper into the abyss

- it's hard to go to school when feeling like a waste of space and time not just for society, but for the people who pat me on the back or send me ""are u ok"" messages when I fuck up and break down. Friends aren't my therapists. Can't confide in them without disrupting the harmony. Therapy doesn't seem to help either.

- missed too many opportunities to even settle for security

- becoming hyper aware of my faults despite knowing that no one gives a shit and drained whenever talking to people for too long

- at fifteen I vowed that if I still didn't find the point at eighteen, I'd fly to somewhere isolated, drive to a remote area in said area and go with carbon monoxide poisoning. It's still a viable option now

- I'm too much of the wrong things and too little of the good to end up somewhere, let alone anywhere

- externalization used to help. Now it doesn't. Wake up in the morning feeling too tired to smile and ask other people about their days when small talk comes

- I know I could be experiencing actual problems (human trafficking, my own cancer (like I'm not cancer already), be entrapped in poverty), and that just because life is pointless doesn't mean I can't make the best out of it. I know.  I want to begin each sentence with something other than ""I,"" but life itself is a yoke best delegated to those who can handle the heat. I'm me. I'm a piece of self-aware waste who realizes her insignificance. 

- typing this out because echo chambers are fun when no one knows who you are and will forget

- might go to Germany this December and do the deed if I swim into deeper waters of indifference; haven't reached the stage of numbing apathy yet. There are times I'm on the verge.

- meditation may at least help with calming myself down, and the Practical Guide to Suicide is relaxing to read a bit of at night

- sorry for typing too much. Oh-oh, brevity, it's working against me

- I hate myself and am indifferent to myself but still utilize humor to cope with the drudgery. Yay.

He used to send messages to the Group Chat on Insta at 12 at midnight, and not one person would ask him...

""Why are you posting this much?""

We got so used to him being high, so I let it go. The last time I spoke to him, I asked him, ""Why do you lie to yourself about spirituality? You're coping with something."" He responded that he genuinely likes it and makes him happy. The next couple of days, the Group Chat went silent. 

Woke up and got a call from a crying friend. 

""He killed himself."" 

My whole body went into shock. I couldn't believe it. I still can't. Our close friend is gone. And I can't help but blame myself. I could've done more. I COULDVE DONE MORE. Tell his parents he was struggling. Call him up and have a discussion. Meet up in person. We spent so much time together man.

I'm not going into why I'm going to do it, only childhood/continuing Trauma, medical condition is the cause.  I've seen videos of failed suicide attempts with people with blasted faces and I don't want that.  They say to angle the gun (a 1911) 15 degrees so you will be aiming between the brain and spinal cord.  It would be kinda hard to shoot from behind.  That would cause instant death.  Or the heart.

56233,"I laugh so I don't cry Yesterday I went down to my local library with the goal in mind. There was a subject that's been on my mind a lot lately and I'm the crack addict of reading and learning, so once I decided that's what I wanted to do I had to drive my happy ass down there. I walk in and make a b-line straight for that desk where there's always two or three old women pretending to work and I'm pretty sure just mutter under their breath ‚ÄúPlease don't talk to me, just keep walking fucker‚Äù over and over and then give you that customer service smile. Well I hate to ruin your day lady, but I'm here to learn today. So I ask this old lady, ‚ÄúDo you have any books on suicide?‚Äù     
  She gives me the nastiest look and her face scrunched up so much she could've passed herself off as a sharpei. Then in her high old grandma voice she shrieked ‚ÄúNo, not again! We don't lend those out anymore since we never get them back!‚Äù    
  None of this happened of course, all this was just a clever ruse to make you feel more invested in this post so it'd be harder for you to skip it. Terribly sorry for the deception. In all actuality this post is about how I've gotten to the point where I am now, on a throwaway account about to spill my life story to the entirety of the internet. To make up for my previous betrayal though, I will hide my SS# somewhere in this post, but onto the point of this whole show.     
    
  I've been pretty suicidal lately. I've multiple suicide attempts and by multiple I mean over thirty. I've came close four times. The was in the dead of winter at one in the morning. I walked into the middle of the woods, drank a bottle of liquor and took my coat off. Changed my mind but almost didn't make it because it was next to impossible to get back up and move. Next one was drowning myself, then overdosing, and then VSED.     
    
  At this point I'm in my early thirties and I've lived more life than most people will live before they're in their fifties. Due to the incompetence of my mother, I've lost all my siblings to all sorts of nastiness. My sister managed to kill herself from alcoholism at the age of 23 four years ago. She was jaundiced to hell and back and all of her organs shut down. She went into a coma and never woke up. My mother had let her get away with drinking since she was ten as well as letting all sorts of people into the house who used hard drugs with her. My other sibling got on the wrong side of the law and got less than what she deserved.     
  I was the second born. I had a lot of problems growing up, a lot. I was and am mentally challenged and it made my life really hard. I was always told by everyone in my family that I'll end up in a ditch someday or that I'll be living under a bridge. I was constantly berated and belittled, always told the reason why I had such a hard time was because I was lazy and not trying hard enough. I was told that I wasn't actually sick.     
  Even more, I get the distinct impression that I was only ever viewed as a possession by my mother. She's what I refer to as a ‚ÄúCollector‚Äù anymore. She acquires things that are pretty to look at and surrounds herself in things she can boast about to make up for her own personal shortcomings. She has done this her entire life from knick-knacks to animals. There are no pictures of any of her children in the house except for children's pictures and she would always lament on the fact that ‚ÄúWe were so cute before we grew up‚Äù and we were raised to be servants.     
  We were forced to massage my mother's feet, back, and neck as well as scratch her back. If we didn't, we'd be grounded and guilted. She would change her cloths in the middle of the house, bathe and use the bathroom with the door wide open. My siblings were allowed to walk around the house naked until their midteens.     
  Then we almost never had food but for some reason there was always money for budweiser, wild turkey, and pall malls. Then there was the sheer amount of abuse that went on. It'd be one in the morning and all of the sudden my bedroom door would fly open, my mother drunk as hell, screaming for me to get into the living room. There, she would yell at me and my sisters for half an hour, doing everything she could to demean us. It got to the point where I'd wake up in the middle of the night at the slightest noise, ready to hop out of bed to defend myself. I live alone now but I still wake at the slightest noise and my bedroom door is always locked when I'm sleeping at night. At one point I took a stand and told her when she asked for beer money no, I wasn't going to give it to her. She assaulted me, and it wasn't the last time.   
  I was unable to work, completely and utterly, and always told that because I have a mood disorder I should just get over myself and that this was just a crutch and no one should have to deal with my bullshit. I got disability and paid of my debts but suddenly my mother demanded all the money I was getting saying she was owed it. .      
    
  At this point in my life, I'm no longer in contact with any family. I made attempts to keep in contact with them, but they didn't reciprocate. I've come to realize there is a strong chance they never cared much to begin with. No one has even called to see if I'm alive and they have my number.     
  I live alone and I'm on a ton of government programs to keep me going since I'm not able to work. I feel like I've failed society as a whole for not being better than I am, even though I know most people would be dead or worse with everything I've been through. I can't even handle minute levels of stress without having a full blown break down. If people raise their voice I normally end up breaking down in tears shortly after. I'm constantly so depressed that I'm hardly able to take care of myself as I struggle to remain functioning. I jump at any noise and constantly have to reassure myself that people aren't gas lightning me or plotting against me. I can't be in a room without having my back to a wall and able to see all points of entrance, same with sleeping. Speaking of sleeping, I have a fear of going to bed anymore because each night I go to sleep I experience dreadful dreams where I feel actual pain and I'm either reliving experiences from my past or its a brand new fresh kind of hell, like last night I was dissected while alive and awake and it was excruciating and this is every night.     
  Additionally, I'm often alienated from a lot of social groups due to my political beliefs or my sexual preferences. In this current climate, I've been told that I'm a traitor, a monster, someone who should just go hang themselves, and someone who will never be loved. This is a constant from a lot of people. I'm a moderate conservative but I also suffer from GID and identify as a woman and asexual, so I'm kind of being shafted from three different directions there. To clarify on my mood disorder, rapid cycling manic depressive. So, in short, I'm socially isolated for a multitude of reasons.     
  I've started to question if it would be better that I was dead so I was no longer a drain on societies resources so that someone that can be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù can get the help they need. The amount of pain I go through is intense and I'm constantly paddling just to keep my head above water. I feel like if I can't get well enough to go back to work then I shouldn't be here. My friends have been helping me get over this mentality but when they aren't around it just surges back. I don't want to be on assistance the rest of my life but I only get worse as I get older. It's reached the point where I'm considering getting certain things done to ensure the outcome I want. All I know is, I've been in the wards over a dozen times in my life and I sure as hell am not going back again. I do see my case worker and therapist this week along with a nurse, and I'm attending groups so I'm not out in the wind here.     
  I just don't want to live this way the rest of my life, in this place on this kind of money, but I can't get past all this. Additionally, I'm well educated and I'm a pretty cool fucking woman. I'm also good looking (even though I don't like my body, I can't deny good looks), and I'm not lacking self confidence and I'm a blast to hang out with, but how many people are going to even consider me a potential partner? I'm horribly crippled by my mental illness, my PTSD, then there is my GID, ontop of the fact that I don't have a job and no substantial income to speak of. I'd also like to clarify all conditions stated in here are diagnosed by professionals.     
  But this is my entire rant and I'm sitting here not wanting to go to bed because of what I'll go through when I'm asleep and torn between starting VSED again or not. Also, I lied again. I didn't put my SS# in here, forgive me.

I can't become close to anyone. I can't feel comfortable with anyone no matter how hard I try. 

My whole life has been fucked up by people who enjoy hurting me for no reason. I don't get it. Why me? I didn't do anything. I was just trying to be a fucking kid and I couldn't because my dad was always there to make me tell myself that I'm worthless. All I wanted was a normal childhood and his abuse robbed me from it. Why couldn't I have had parents that loved me... maybe then I wouldn't be so fucked up. Maybe I wouldn't be so fucked up if all those men didn't rape and hurt me and mentally abuse me. 

I've been crying all day just thinking about how lonely I am and how hopeless I feel. No one has ever loved me. No one has ever made me feel safe.

I just want someone who won't leave me and someone who will make me feel safe. That's all I ever wanted. The guy I love continues to use me and will soon leave my life. He just used me for his own benefit. He never cared. I considered him my best friend and he treats me like shit and always has. Why pick me to use. Why pick me to destroy? I'm already fucked up. I wish he would've chosen someone else to do this to. Why does everyone leave.. why am I impossible to love? 

I have absolutely no trust in anyone. Im scared of everyone. I'm just thinking about how nice it would be to slit my wrists and just slowly bleed out. 

I'm too depressed to study. I'm too depressed to get up to eat. There's no point in continuing. I will never experience love. I will never experience a kind hand or comfort. My whole life I have been so uncomfortable, so scared and so hopeless.

I really need to end it sometime soon. this can't continue. I'm in constant pain and absolutely nothing will help. The memories of the traumas of my past are never out of my mind. They keep haunting me and I'm sick of it. I just want to die. I want to wait for a weekend where he goes out of town and just slash my wrists in the bathtub and bleed out. I'll write a letter on the door to call 911 so no one has to see. 

Maybe then people will realize that it's not okay to hurt or use others. Maybe then the people who've hurt me will finally realize what they've done is wrong. And I'll finally be free from all this pain. I hate myself so much. I hate this life. I hate how terrible people are surrounded with so much love and I have none when I have always put others before me.

Life is shit. I'm so tired of it. I hope I'll get the courage to end it all soon.

47001,"Advice for how to help/understand suicidal girlfriendHopefully this is the right sub to reach out too, mods please let me know if not.  

Tl;Dr - last 3 paragraphs (sorry about the wall of text, just wanted to get the full story out there to show I know my actions are at least part of the reason her depression is affecting her so much)  

I'm reaching out to see if anyone could help give me some advice on how to handle what my girlfriend is going through. Even if you can just share your experiences to help me understand the pain that she's feeling, I guess I hope that could help me understand why she sees no other option than to end it.  

Background - both of us are late 20's, she's been through a divorce, has a therapist and psychiatrist, no overwhelming debt or carreer problems and our relationship is 85% good, while the 15% bad times arent too extreme (as not extreme as two very stubborn people can be).  
Her depression began after her divorce but was getting better by the time we began talking. Her therapist had cut down how often her visits were and once we started had even seen the relationship as positive for her. I've had some trust issues in the past but it seems that's I've given her the space she needs to work with herself while building the trust that I never thought I'd have for someone else.  

The change - we began fighting about stupid little things. She would tell small lies to prevent a fight and I would be afraid this could lead to much larger lies. She told more, I lost trust, we fought, and she no longer could no longer really picture her dream wedding with me. She wanted full, no questions asked trust, but I needed full honest at all times.  
This led to a period of a suffocating relationship where we would fight every time that we would talk. I'd think everything was fine but she'd be dwelling on something I didn't even know was an issue. I'd try to work through it, she'd ask why I was so intent on fighting all the time, eventually she would apologize, I'd apologize, neither really knew what the cause or resolution was but we'd just want to get back to our happy, fun, loving, relationship. This was basically a weekly cycle but it kinda felt like we were working through different issues each time so I thought progress was being made. Meanwhile she began more often therapist appointments but stressed the relationship was not the problem (I obviously started suspecting it was taking a toll on her).  
After this I began submitting to many issues that would arise, I would rather back down on something I disagree with than to push her back into the depression/suicidal corner. Unfortunately this led to me bottling things up and when she would begin dwelling on something that I couldn't imagine being a problem (ie - the tone of a 3 word SMS about work) I would fight back about how stupid the topic of the fight was about.  

New year new me - for new years eve we had a very frank and honest discussion about how each of us felt and what our future could hold. This is when she told me her ex had told her 9 months ago that if she was still hurting and wanting to end it, that he would help her get whatever she needed (sympathetic type of thing, which I can't understand). She told me how much I ment to her, how sorry she was for how bad she'd messed everything up, and how her time with me was some of the greatest of her life. She said I would get a proper goodbye when the time is near but never wants me to forget this, and that it's absolutely not my fault.  
I've dated girls who's talked about suicide before but this is the first time it's sounded like someone was actually planning it. I told her how much she means to me, how id rather us not be together and her find happiness but still be here, on this earth. We talked about religion and how if it's all correct her pain and suffering would be just as terrible on the other side. Once she expressed how absolutely against breaking up she was we even talked about marriage and started planning a month long trip in the summer (this is when I thought things were getting better).  

The last 24 hours - everything since the NYE talk things were great. Every moment together was amazing and all we could talk about was our futures. *(I forgot to mention we are in a long distance relationship)*  
Then she boarded her flight to go home. While flying, landing, flying, landing, etc, we had a misunderstanding that apparently affected her very very badly (throwing up, unable to sleep, panic attacks, on flight). This led to a huge fight today mostly because I was so confused about what she was so hurt by, I'm still not sure what it was and suspect i may have mostly been fighting with the depression and not her.  

After the fight she messaged me and told me her goodbye. I tried not to freak out, and tried to calmly talk to her about everyone that cares about her and how much joy she brings us. The reasons are bring nothing but anger and sadness to everyone around her and not being able to stop the pain. I also asked her to please talk to her therapist about being at this point, see if she can offer somethibg that could help, drugs, support groups, anything, anything that helps her stop this pain but allows us that love her so much to still have her in our lives. She agreed to talk to the therapist and said she wouldn't do anything tonight, also agreed to Skype as I told her I deserve one last face to face goodbye before she does something like this.  

That's where I'm at, I don't know what to do. I don't know when to reach out to close friends/family as I know this would break her trust in me and prevent her from talking to me any further. I also don't understand this pain, I don't know how she can hurt so bad, but love life and everyone so much. She really does love life, travels all of the time, and is the most loving, passionate girl I've ever been with. But for me, I can't imagine an emotional pain that getting high/drunk all weekend wouldn't silence.  
I don't want to stand ideally by, but I don't want to overact and call in the troops when she's still working through this herself. I also really don't want to loose her trust and just wake up one morning to a call from her family that she's gone, when she may have told me that night and I could have called them and prevented it.  

So reddit, any advice/tips/stories that I could ask her to read, would be greatly appreciated. I just don't know when or how to act, this is all so new to me but I'd do literally anything and everything to save this girl and help her handle her pain. It also scares me to death to imagine loosing her.  

Edit - after looking at the sidebar I found that my talks with her about suicide have been appropriate for the most part. I've listened a lot and focused on being here for her so she isn't alone through this. While I have talked about those of us that love her, I've also focused on how I don't understand the pain that she feels and simply wish I knew a way to take it away. But that's why I'm here, I'm standing by her side through this and she knows it (which makes me tear up knowing she trusts me this much) I'm not just telling her it's going to be ok, but I just don't know how to get us to where everything will be ok.

I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a very long time. I have made a post on here three months ago, that day I didn't attempt. I hated myself for who I am. I thought my death was the only possible solution, I thought it was the only option I had left.

I attempted suicide in February, that was the second time I nearly died. My sister's birthday was two days ago, mine is coming up soon. I have been struggling with substance abuse. I have been off of hard drugs for a month now. My family is very religious but they are more accepting of me being gay than I could have ever imagined.

If I had succeeded, I would have missed out on so many things. I would have missed out on my sister growing up or playing fetch with the dog my neighbours recently adopted. I would have never seen the way water clings to cobwebs again. I would have missed out on the concert I went to with my friends or the new album that's coming out. I would have missed out on life.

I'm not going to say that it will get better, because that will most likely not help you and because it might not seem like it does. But it got better for me. I used to think that I wouldn't mind missing out on all those things because I would be dead, but that's not true.",suicide

61683,"Something I was gonna post. I thought I'd share anyway.So basically I just started ranting and typing things that came to mind. Eventually I was not feeling like I did when I started but I went to the effort to type it, someone may find it interesting.

Title: Want to die, but can't.

tl:dr; The heading

So basically there is a whole lot of me that want's to just give up. I mean, I have this masterful plan which involves a bridge and a rope to end with a bang but there is this tiny part of me that doesn't.

I'll give you some history. I usually come across as shy, (somewhat) arogant and seems like I don't have a lot to say (which is usually the case). Combined with the non-stop emotional slaughter my sister gives me almost daily, I'm not that out going which I think is part of me feeling like this.

There is also the year of bullying I got at school but that wasn't as big of a factor I don't think since I tought care of that (the right way, no fights). Now this may come across pathetic (probably is), but I have no real friends that are girls. I mean, yeah, I can say 'hey' to quite a few but I won't get invited out or anything.

Even with guy friends I am usually the last one to be called for anything mainly because I live the furtherest away from the places to go socialise (I want to move closer) and for how I am, I suspect.

Also, at the start of the year I was almost in a relationship with a girl. Yes almost, but the long and short of it is, she chose someone else over me which doesn't help much either.

Since grade 10 I have had my mind set on becoming an engineer and I'm currently doing that. I'm in my second year (woo!), but I dislike the actual engineering part (not the math, but moments, forces, bending etc) and I'm not sure if it's what I want to do. 

Combined with that my part time job (actually a casual job but more of a part time thing) is so dead end, I can barely pay for my fuel to drive to uni, if my car breaks I am fucked six ways with no hope and I am not guaranteed any hours so I can't save any money since some weeks I can't work due to uni finishing late some days and them not having any hours.

To make things worse, my mum (who I live with), is having some financial trouble - we should be good in a few weeks hopefully - but I still am stressed about not being able to pay for anything. Also, my sister constantly reminds me about of this, tells me to go to work (when she knows how it is) and tells me I do nothing for my mum (I help with computer stuff and tech stuff, but dont really wash anything unless she goes away for a while).

I've tried to get another job but Uni is such a pain to work around. I am only free 4 days a week (2 being the weekend) and this means every other applicant has an edge over me already. I want to become a freelance web designer while at uni but am not sure I can take that much responsiblity by myself.

I'm doing alright at Uni to (5.85 out of 7 for my first year), but as I said, I don't really like what I am doing. Also, my degree has like 10 girls in total so that also crushes me hopes at making any good friends (no girlfriends, just friends).

I know I probably have it alright, I know someone is probably homeless who is reading this or something but I just can't shake the feeling.

My plan was to go to this bridge and drop a rock off. time how long it takes to fall, and work out the birdge height (might as well put those physics to use aye?). Then buy some rope that is just over half the length of the bridge and tie a dead mans knot at the end. then drive to the bridge one night, and tie the rope to the railing and.. jump off. I even went so far as to learn the knot, but that was partly me just being curious.

And a few nights this year I have just cried, just thinking about me until I get so tired and fall asleep. I guess I just don't see anything in me. I have tried to be really nice to people. I've done the douchebag thing to people. I've been myself. I can't even reconize any signs  from this girl talk to regulary (the only one, mostly over msn, yes, how pathetic..) and she said she does like white men (like me, she is asian) but i am too scared to make things awkward and ruin what little i already have.. like I did with someone at the start of the year.

I'm not sure what I should do. I'm not fat, atheletic build... people think I am ""smart"" (omg you can code css!) and I don't do drugs or have done anything criminal... i mean, other people like me can talk with nice people and that. There is just something I want to fix, need to fix... but don't know what.

So I guess I am depressed, but I am not gonna go on medication to feel better... I am pretty anti drug for anything. I suppose...and I don;t want to tell anyone or else I'll be judged like no tomorrow. I mean it will be ""hey, its the guy that thinks about killing himself, lets be sure to be nice so he doesn't try anything""..

Oh btw, you may think ""dude that girl was over 3 months away! And I know, I don't have feelings for this girl.. but it still plays on my mind what I almost had (the relationship). I mean, I have nevr had a real girlfriend. Yeah, heaps of people on reddit are the same, i read it all the time but that doesn't make me feel any better.  I guess you could say I want someone to care about me. Which I do, but then again, I don;t want to screw anything up. I suppose I am scared of making things worse so i'll continue to be unhappy. I'm quite energised to tell this new girl how i feel but a friend of mine already liked her... and he asked her but she flat out rejected him. now It would be the biggedt dick move to try ask from my perspective. If i ask, and she says no, it'll be awkward  between us. if i ask and she says yes, our mutual friends will think less of me and her and the my friend will probably hate my guts... and then if things so wrong I lose/become awkward with half of my friends... and we go to the same Uni.

Man...it feels good to write this down, I'm quite happy but still stressed out. I forgot to mention I have an exam tomorrow which I am not fully prepared for. I mean, I know the principles. I know how to do it, except for the one part. I try and do it but I'm always slightly off and get it wrong. It's a kick in the balls when you study, understand it in the lecture and get home and attempt the assignment and you have no idea where to start and there are no examples even like it.

I'm pretty alright now I guess... or maybe I am just tired. In anycase you guys might like to hear my problems. Don't worry, that little part of me won't let me kill myself (like how the candidates on lost cant kill themselves).
